PLEASE WELCOME THE CEO OF AWS,
ADAM SELIPSKY.
GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE
12TH ANNUAL REINVENT. I AM SO
HAPPY TO BE HERE WITH MORE THAN
50,000 OF YOU HERE IN LAS VEGAS
AND MORE THAN 300,000 WATCHING
AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR
JOINING. THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU
. NOW, WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THIS
EVENT JUST A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENTLY AND REINVENT REMAINS
ABOVE ALL, A LEARNING
CONFERENCE, A LEARNING EVENT,
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN
AND GROW HERE ARE EVERYWHERE.
WE'VE GOT MORE THAN 2200
SESSIONS, AND YOU CAN CONNECT
WITH AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
PARTNERS IN THE EXPO ALL AROUND.
AND OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY,
MANY OPPORTUNITY WIZ TO CONNECT
WITH FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE AWS
COMMUNITY. SO WE'VE ALSO GOT A
GREAT SLATE OF KEYNOTES FOR YOU.
YESTERDAY, LAST NIGHT, HOPEFULLY
A LOT OF YOU SAW PETER DIVE INTO
ALL OF OUR INNOVATION AROUND
SERVERLESS. AND TOMORROW WE'VE
GOT SWAMI ON AI AND MACHINE
LEARNING AS WELL AS RUBA'S
PARTNER KEYNOTE. AND THEN OF
COURSE, WERNER CAPS OFF THE WEEK
ON THURSDAY. BUT I'M EXTREMELY
EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE IN
STORE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW HERE
TODAY. SO LET'S GET STARTED. SO
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT
REINVENT IS THE SHEER VARIETY OF
THE CUSTOMERS THAT I GET TO
MEET. I MEAN, FOLKS FROM EVERY
INDUSTRY, EVERY REGION, EVERY
USE CASE. AND THERE'S JUST
NOTHING LIKE IT ANYWHERE FOR AN
INNOVATORS ALL OVER THE WORLD
ARE RELYING ON AWS TO DRIVE
THEIR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING
LEADING ENTERPRISES FROM ACROSS
EVERY INDUSTRY, JUST TO NAME A
FEW IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE'RE
WORKING WITH JPMORGAN CHASE.
WE'RE WORKING WITH GOLDMAN
SACHS, NASDAQ, FIDELITY, ALLIANZ
ITYOU, BBVA, HSBC, GE CAPITAL
ONE, S&P GLOBAL NUBANK AND MORE.
IN HEALTH CARE, WE'RE WORKING
WITH PFIZER, GILEAD, MERCK, NOVO
NORDISK ROCHE, MODERNA, ILLUMINA
. MEDTRONIC 3M HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MORE. IN
AUTOMOTIVE, WE'RE WORKING WITH
EVERYBODY FROM BMW TO STELLANTIS
HONDA, TOYOTA, VW GROUP, NISSAN,
HYUNDAI, FORD MOTOR COMPANY,
MERCEDES BENZ, AND OF COURSE,
MORE. SO MANY AMAZING CUSTOMERS
AND PARTNERS AND STILL JUST A
SMATTERING OF THE LEADERS WE'RE
WORKING WITH TO SHAPE THE
FUTURES OF THESE INDUSTRIES. AND
ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
THAT THEY SERVE. ONE CUSTOMER
AND PARTNER. WE'VE BEEN WORKING
CLOSELY WITH FOR A NUMBER OF
YEARS IS SALESFORCE. SO IN 2016,
SALESFORCE CHOSE AWS AS THEIR
PRIMARY CLOUD PROVIDER, AND
TODAY SALESFORCE USES AWS
COMPUTE STORAGE DATA SERVICE AS
MANY OTHERS TO POWER KEY
SERVICES LIKE SALESFORCE, DATA
CLOUD AND MANY OTHERS. AND
YESTERDAY WE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
OUR PARTNERSHIP TO BRING NEW
CAPABILITIES TO OUR MUTUAL
CUSTOMERS. SALESFORCE IS GOING
TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
ITS ALREADY VERY LARGE USE OF
AWS. AWS WILL BE USING MORE
SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGIES AND
WE'RE MAKING IT EASIER FOR
DEVELOPERS TO QUICKLY BUILD AND
DEPLOY GENERATIVE AI
APPLICATIONS. JENS BY BRINGING
TOGETHER AMAZON BEDROCK WITH
SALESFORCE'S EINSTEIN PLATFORM.
WE'RE ALSO HELPING TO UNIFY DATA
MANAGEMENT WITH OUR NEW ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS BETWEEN SALESFORCE
DATA CLOUD AND AWS STORAGE AND
COMPUTE AND DATA SERVICE DATA
AND ANALYTICS SERVICES. SO THE
CUSTOMERS CAN GET EVEN BETTER
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND WE'RE ALSO
BUILDING TIGHTER INTEGRATIONS
BETWEEN SERVICE CLOUD FROM
SALESFORCE AND AMAZON CONNECT.
ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME,
SALESFORCE IS GOING TO BE
PUTTING ITS PRODUCTS ON THE
MARKET PLACE, MAKING IT EVEN
EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO FIND, TO
BUY AND TO MANAGE SALESFORCE
OFFERINGS. SO WITH THIS EXPANDED
PARTNERSHIP AND SALESFORCE
CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO GET NEW,
POWERFUL WAYS TO INNOVATE AND
BUILD APPLICATIONS. BUT IT'S NOT
JUST GLOBAL ENTERPRISE IS THE
MOST PROMISING UP AND COMER ALSO
CONTINUE TO CHOOSE AWS AS WELL.
ACCORDING TO PITCHBOOK, THERE
ARE MORE THAN 1000 UNICORNS OR
STARTUPS WITH OVER $1 BILLION IN
VALUATION, AND THE VAST MAJORITY
OF UNICORNS OVER 80% CHOOSE AWS
LIKE WIZ, A CLOUD SECURITY
COMPANY AND GREAT AWS PARTNER.
WIZ IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST CYBER
SECURITY UNICORN AND FASTEST
SAAS COMPANY. TO REACH A $10
BILLION VALUATION. REALLY
AMAZING OR ULTIMATE GENOMICS,
ONE OF FAST COMPANY'S MOST
INNOVATIVE COMPANIES IN BIOTECH
AND ULTIMO IS REVOLUTIONIZING
DNA SEQUENCING BY REDUCING THE
COST OF SEQUENCING SIX FOLD OR
PLAID PLAIDS. A DATA STARTUP
THAT POWERS FINTECH TOOLS LIKE
VENMO, ACORN AND ROBINHOOD THAT
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE USING TO
MANAGE THEIR FINANCES. CUSTOMERS
OF EVERY SIZE, EVERY INDUSTRY,
ORI, EVERY REGION, ORGANIZATIONS
YOU MIGHT NEVER IMAGINE CHAN
WOULD RELY ON THE CLOUD ARE
INNOVATING ON AWS. I JUST
RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT LOUDEN
GUITARS, A K10 EXPERT GUITAR
MAKER LOCATED IN A TINY VILLAGE
IN IRELAND, AND THEY'RE USING
AWS TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN
ELECTRONIC PASSPORT PROGRAM
THAT'S GOING TO EASE THE PASSAGE
OF THEIR VERY SPECIAL GUITARS
FOR MUSICIANS AS THEY TRAVEL
THROUGH CUSTOMS. I MEAN, ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES. IT'S AMAZING
ENTERPRISE WIZ AND STARTUPS,
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED
BUSINESSES, UNIVERSITIES,
COMMUNITY COLLEGES, GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, NONPROFITS. THE CLOUD
IS FOR ANYONE AND OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE SOLVING BIG PROBLEMS,
SERVING CRITICAL NEEDS AND
DREAMING UP THE WORLD'S NEXT BIG
THING. THEY COUNT ON US TO BE
SECURE, TO BE RELIABLE, TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY, TO DELIGHT
THEIR CUSTOMERS AND ENABLE NEW
WAYS TO GROW THEIR BUSINESSES.
ALL ALL ON AWS. SO WHY IS ALL
THIS HAPPENING? ON AWS, WE ARE
RELENTLESS ABOUT WORKING
BACKWARDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS
NEEDS AND FROM THEIR PAIN
POINTS. AND OF COURSE WE WERE
THE FIRST BY ABOUT 5 TO 7 YEARS
TO HAVE THIS BROADEST AND
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES THAT
WE STILL HAVE TODAY. AND WE'RE
THE MOST SECURE AND THE MOST
RELIABLE, BUT WE ALSO THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS
PROBLEMS AND THEIR POTENTIAL.
AND THIS HAS LED US TO REINVENT
CONTINUOUS ALI, TO PUSH THROUGH
THE BARRIERS OF WHAT PEOPLE
THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. SO YOU CAN
DO THE SAME. REINVENTING IS IN
OUR DNA AND IT CONTINUES TO
DRIVE US EVERY DAY. AFTER ALL,
THIS IS HOW CLOUD COMPUTING CAME
TO BE. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF
OPERATING OPERATING AMAZON.COM.
WE EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND HOW
HARD, HOW EXPENSIVE IT WAS TO
PROVISION AND MANAGE
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW MUCH OF
THE UNDIFFERENTIATED HEAVY
LIFTING THERE WAS THAT
DISTRACTED, REALLY TALENTED
TEAMS FROM REALLY INNOVATING. SO
WE SET OUT TO RETHINK IT.
INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETELY WITH
AWS. SO EVERYONE, EVEN A KID AND
A COLLEGE DORM ROOM, COULD HAVE
ACCESS TO THE SAME POWERFUL
TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO THE
LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED
ORGANIZATIONS. ALL ON DEMAND,
ALL SECURE, ALL RELIABLE AND ALL
COST EFFECTIVE. NOW IF FOLKS GOT
PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AS
THEY MOVED INTO THE CLOUD, SOME
EVEN HOSTED DATA CENTER CLOSING
PARTIES AND POSTED VIDEOS OF
SHUTTING DOWN SERVER ROOMS. IT
WAS REALLY, REALLY FUN. THIS WAS
FUN FOR US. SO WE INVENTED
REINVENTED INFRASTRUC FROM THE
GROUND UP TO OPTIMIZE AWS FOR
SCALE, FOR SECURITY, FOR
RELIABILITY, FROM ROUTERS TO
COOLING SYSTEMS TO NETWORKING
PROTOCOLS. AND BECAUSE WE LOOK
AT THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, OUR
GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE WAS
FUNDAMENTALLY DISTINCT FROM THAT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS. AND
THAT IS STILL TRUE TODAY. FOR
EXAMPLE, THE AWS GLOBAL
INFRASTRUCTURE SPANS 32
GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AROUND THE
WORLD AND WE'VE ANNOUNCED PLANS
FOR FIVE OR SO MORE EACH AND
EVERY REGION CONSISTS OF THREE
OR MORE AVAILABILITY ZONES OR
AZS AND NO OTHER CLOUD PROVIDER
PROVIDES THAT IN EVERY SINGLE
GEOGRAPHIC REGION. AND THIS IS
CRITICAL WITH EACH REGION. THE
AZS ARE PHYSICALLY SEPARATED BY
A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE UP TO 60
MILES OR 100KM. AND THEN THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH REDUNDANT
FIBER NETWORK THAT PROVIDES
SINGLE DIGIT MILLISECOND
LATENCY. NOW EACH AZ IS AT LEAST
ONE FULLY DISCRETE DATA CENTER
WITH ITS OWN REDUNDANT POWER
WATER FOR NETWORKING AND
CONNECTIVITY. SO IF THERE'S A
UTILITY FAILURE, UNEXPECTED
TRAFFIC SPIKE, HUMAN MISTAKE OR
EVEN A NATURAL DISASTER, THE
REGION REMAINS OPERATIONAL AND
SO DO YOUR APPLICATIONS. NOW,
OTHERS WOULD HAVE YOU THINK THAT
ALL CLOUDS ARE THE SAME, BUT
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. I MEAN,
IMAGINE IF YOU HAD A REGION
SUPPORTED BY A SINGLE DATA
CENTER OR IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR
PROVIDER HAD MULTIPLE AZS IN
FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND YOU
WERE RESILIENT. BUT IT TURNED
OUT THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THE
SAME LOCATION. I MEAN, ONE
INCIDENT LIKE A WATER LEAK
FOLLOWED BY A FIRE COULD TAKE
DOWN AN ENTIRE REGION FOR DAYS
DUE. HAVING THE BROADEST AND THE
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES
MATTERS LIKE HAVING THREE TIMES
THE THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF
DATA CENTERS COMPARED TO THE
NEXT LARGEST CLOUD PROVIDER,
WHICH MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN
CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY AND
HAVING 60% MORE SERVICES IN OVER
40% MORE FEATURES THAN THE NEXT
CLOSEST CLOUD PROVIDER. SO YOU
CAN INNOVATE WITHOUT
CONSTRAINTS. WE REINVENT IT SO
THAT YOU CAN REINVENT, TAKE
STORAGE, FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE
CERTAINLY DIDN'T INVENT STORAGE,
BUT WE REINVENTED HOW PEOPLE
CONSUME AND SCALE STORAGE IN THE
CLOUD WITH OUR VERY FIRST CLOUD
SERVICE, AMAZON S3, SIMPLE
STORAGE SERVICE SO BACK IN THE
DAY, STORAGE WAS PRIMARILY DISK
ARRAYS, WHICH COULD TAKE WEEKS
TO PROVISION AND OBVIOUSLY HAD
FINITE CAPACITY. SO S3 PROVIDED
HIGHLY DURABLE, HIGHLY
PERFORMANT OBJECT STORAGE THAT
CUSTOMERS COULD SCALE INSTANTLY
AND NEARLY INFINITELY. AND I
REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT S3 AT OUR
VERY FIRST TRADE SHOW IN 2006,
ON THE DAY THAT IT LAUNCHED, AND
FOLKS HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING
THE COST. I MEAN, IT WAS SO
DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN WHAT
THEY WERE USED TO, BUT WE KEPT
GOING. WE ADDED A WHOLE LOT OF
STORAGE TIERS, INCLUDING S3
GLACIER, DEEP ARCHIVE, WHICH
DELIVERS ARCHIVE STORAGE AT LESS
THAN A 10TH OF A CENT PER
GIGABYTE. BUT WHY SHOULD YOU
HAVE TO EVEN FIGURE OUT WHICH
STORAGE TIER TO USE? SO WE BUILT
S3 INTELLIGENT-TIERING TO
OPTIMIZE STORAGE BY
AUTOMATICALLY MOVING DATA TO THE
MOST EFFECTIVE ACCESS TIER WHEN
ACCESS PATTERNS CHANGE.
INTELLIGENT-TIERING HAS ALREADY
SAVED CUSTOMERS. YOU READY? OVER
$2 BILLION, BUT IT'S JUST
STORAGE, RIGHT? I MEAN, HERE'S
TO THE SAVINGS. BUT STORAGE,
RIGHT? I MEAN, SURELY THIS CAN'T
BE AN AREA THAT'S READY FOR MORE
REINVENTION. WELL, RECENTLY
WE'VE BEEN RETHINKING STORAGE
FOR YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED AND MOST LATENCY
SENSITIVE WORKLOADS, WORKLOADS
THAT NEED HIGH PERFORMANCE
ANALYTICS PROCESSING, LIKE
FINANCIAL TRADING ANALYTICS,
REAL TIME ADVERTISING, FRAUD
DETECTION AND MACHINE LEARNING
TRAINING. NOW THESE WORKLOADS
ACCESS DATA UP TO MILLIONS OF
TIMES IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AND
DO REQUIRE SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. AND SO
TODAY WHAT HAPPENS IS CUSTOMERS
MOVE DATA OFTEN FROM S3 TO
CUSTOM CACHING SOLUTIONS AND
THEN RUN ANALYTICS AT THESE
SPEEDS. BUT MANAGING MULTIPLE
STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURES AND APIS
ADDS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY. SO WE
LOOKED HARD AT WHAT WE COULD DO
TO ADD TO S3 OKAY, ARE YOU READY
FOR THE FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF
THE DAY? OKAY SO TODAY I'M
EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE AMAZON S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE, A NEW S3
STORAGE CLASS PURPOSE BUILT.
PURPOSE BUILT TO OFFER THE
HIGHEST PERFORMANCE AND LOWEST
LATENCY CLOUD OBJECT FOR STORAGE
YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY ACCESSED
DATA. S3 EXPRESS ONE ZONE USES
PURPOSE BUILT HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE TO ACCELERATE DATA
PROCESSING. IT ALSO GIVES YOU
THE OPTION TO ACTUALLY CHOOSE
YOUR AZ FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND
YOU CAN BRING YOUR FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED DATA NEXT TO YOUR HIGH
PERFORMANCE COMPUTE RESOURCE WIZ
TO MINIMIZE LATENCY. SO S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE SUPPORTS
MILLIONS OF REQUESTS PER MINUTE
WITH CONSISTENT SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. THE FASTEST
OBJECT STORAGE IN THE CLOUD AND
UP TO TEN TIMES FASTER THAN S3
STANDARD STORAGE. NOW THE FASTER
DATA PROCESSING LETS YOU SAVE UP
TO 60% ON YOUR COMPUTE COSTS AS
WELL. FOR WORKLOADS THAT REQUIRE
THE HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS
AND THE DATA ACCESS COSTS. ALSO
ARE 50% LOWER THAN S3 STANDARD.
SO YOU CAN RUN THESE WORKLOADS
AT MUCH, MUCH LOWER COST. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, WITH S3 EXPRESS, ONE
ZONE, PINTEREST HAS OBSERVED
OVER TEN TIMES FASTER RIDE
SPEEDS WHILE REDUCED THEIR TOTAL
COST BY 40% FOR ITS MACHINE
LEARNING POWERED VISUAL
INSPIRATION ENGINE. NOW THIS IS
ENABLING THEM TO DO FASTER
EXPERIMENTATION AND
PERSONALIZATION, IMPROVING
EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR USERS. SO
17 YEARS AGO, S3 REINVENTED
STORAGE BY LAUNCHING THE FIRST
CLOUD SERVICE FOR AWS AND WITH
S3 EXPRESS, ONE ZONE, YOU CAN
SEE S3 CONTINUING TO CHANGE HOW
DEVELOPERS USE STORAGE. THE SAME
SIMPLE INTERFACE AND SAME LOW
COST. AND NOW? NOW EVEN FASTER.
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
REINVENTION. GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING. SO WE REALIZED ALMOST
TEN YEARS AGO THAT IF WE WANTED
TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE
ON PRICE PERFORMANCE FOR ALL OF
YOUR WORKLOADS, WE HAD TO
REINVENT GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING FOR THE CLOUD ERA ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO THE SILICON AND
IN 2018, WE BECAME THE FIRST
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER TO DEVELOP
OUR OWN GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTE
PROCESSORS. WHEN WE ANNOUNCED
GRAVITON, OUR SERVER PROCESS OR
CHIP AND CUSTOMERS LOVE THE COST
SAVINGS THAT IT DELIVERED FOR
SCALE OUT WORKLOADS LIKE
MICROSERVICES AND WEB
APPLICATIONS, BUT ASKED FOR MORE
. SO WE BROUGHT YOU GRAVITON2,
WHICH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE SEVEN
FOLD FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF
WORKLOADS AND WE DIDN'T STOP
THERE. OUR CURRENT GENERATION.
GRAVITON THREE DELIVER IS UP TO
25. BETTER COMPUTE PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO GRAVITON2 AND THE
BEST PRICE PERFORMANCE IN EC2.
IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO USES 60%
LESS ENERGY FOR THE SAME LEVEL
OF PERFORMANCE AND THIS IS SO,
SO IMPORTANT TO SO MANY
CUSTOMERS TODAY. AND THAT'S
COMPARED TO COMPARABLE EC2
INSTANCES. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY
IS ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE
IMPORTANT. TODAY. WE'VE GOT OVER
150 GRAVITON BASED INSTANCES
ACROSS THE EC2 PORTFOLIO AND
MORE THAN 50,000 CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING ALL OF THE TOP 100 EC2
CUSTOMERS, USE GRAVITON BASED
INSTANCES TO REALIZE PRICE
PERFORMANCE BENEFITS. FOR
EXAMPLE, SAP, THEY'VE PARTNERED
WITH AWS TO ACTUALLY POWER SAP,
HANA CLOUD WITH GRAVITON AND
WITH GRAVITON. SAP HAS SEEN UP
TO 35% BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
FOR ANALYTICS WORKLOADS AND AIMS
TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT
. THEIR CARBON IMPACT BY AN
ESTIMATED 45. SUPER IMPRESSIVE
OF WE ARE RELENTLESS ABOUT
INNOVATION AND WE CONTINUE TO
PUSH THE ENVELOPE FURTHER. SO
TODAY I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THE LATEST GENERATION OF OUR
GRAVITON PROCESSOR AWS GRAVITON.
FOUR GRAVITON FOUR OR GRAVITON
FOUR IS THE MOST POWERFUL AND
THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT CHIP
THAT WE HAVE EVER BUILT, WITH
50% MORE CORES AND 75% MORE
MEMORY BANDWIDTH THAN GRAVITON.
THREE GRAVITON, FOUR CHIPS ARE
30% FASTER ON AVERAGE THAN
GRAVITON. THREE AND PERFORM EVEN
BETTER FOR CERTAIN WORKLOADS,
LIKE 40% FASTER FOR DATABASE
APPLICATIONS AND 45% FASTER FOR
JAVA APPLICATIONS AS WE WERE THE
FIRST TO DEVELOP AND OFFER OUR
OWN SERVER PROCESSORS, WE'RE NOW
IN OUR FOURTH GENERATION. IN
JUST FIVE YEARS. OTHER CLOUD
PROVIDERS HAVE NOT EVEN
DELIVERED ON THEIR FIRST SERVER
PROCESSORS YET. WE'RE ALSO
ANNOUNCING THE PREVIEW OF OUR
FIRST INSTANCE BASED ON GRAVITON
FOUR RAG INSTANCES AS RAG IS
PART OF OUR MEMORY OPTIMIZED
INSTANCE FAMILY. THEY'RE
DESIGNED TO DELIVER FAST, FAST
PERFORMANCE FOR WORKLOADS. THAT
PROCESS LARGE DATA SETS AND
MEMORY LIKE DATABASES OR REAL
TIME BIG DATA ANALYTICS. RAG
INSTANCES PROVIDE THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY
EFFICIENCY FOR MEMORY INTENSIVE
WORKLOADS AND THERE ARE MANY,
MANY MORE GRAVITON. FOUR
INSTANCES COMING HIGHLY RELIABLE
REGIONS WITH AVAILABILITY ZONES
DURABLE, INSTANTLY SCALABLE, LOW
COST STORAGE, LEADING PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITH CUSTOM DESIGNED
CHIPS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW
EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'RE
REINVENTING TO CONSTANTLY
DELIVER WHAT YOU NEED TO DRIVE
YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE, YOUR
INNOVATION, AND YOUR BUSINESSES.
AND FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES WE
HAVE BEEN SO INTENT ON PROVIDING
YOU WITH THE BROADEST AND
DEEPEST FUNCTIONALITY WITH THE
FAST PACE OF INNOVATION, THE
MOST RELIABLE, THE MOST SECURE
CLOUD SERVICES AND OF COURSE THE
LARGEST AND THE MOST DIVERSE
COMMUNITY OF CUSTOMERS AND
PARTNERS. NOW THESE ADVANTAGES
ARE ALWAYS RELEVANT, BUT NO MORE
SO THAN TODAY, BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALSO THE FOUNDATION FOR
REINVENTING WITH GENERATIVE AI I
NOW HERE TO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
THE BROADEST AND DEEPEST
CAPABILITIES, THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY AND
THE PRIVACY YOU TRUST. YOU NEED
AT ALL. AMAZON HAS BEEN
INNOVATING WITH AI FOR DECADES.
WE USE IT ACROSS THE COMPANY TO
OPTIMIZE THINGS LIKE OUR COMPANY
WIDE SUPPLY CHAIN TO CREATE
BETTER RETAIL SEARCH
CAPABILITIES, WIZ TO DELIVER NEW
EXPERIENCES LIKE AMAZON, ALEXA
OR OUR JUST WALK OUT SHOPPING
TECHNOLOGY. GENAI IS THE NEXT
STEP IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,
AND IT IS GOING TO REINVENT
EVERY APPLICATION THAT WE
INTERACT WITH AT WORK AND AT
HOME. WE'RE READY TO HELP YOU
REINVENT WITH GENERATIVE AI
BECAUSE AGAIN, WE THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES
TO MEET YOUR NEEDS AND WE
REINVENT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND
BECAUSE WE'RE INTIMATELY
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT MEANS TO
REINVENT OURSELVES AS WE
UNDERSTAND HOW TO HELP YOU WITH
YOUR REINVENTIONS. FROM STARTUPS
TO ENTERPRISES, ORGANIZATIONS OF
ALL SIZES ARE GETTING GOING WITH
GENERATIVE AI. THEY WANT TO TAKE
THE MOMENTUM THAT THEY'RE
BUILDING WITH EARLY
EXPERIMENTATION AND TURN IT INTO
REAL WORLD PRODUCTIVITY GAINS
AND INNOVATE, INNOVATE,
INNOVATE. SO WE THINK ABOUT
GENERATIVE AI AS HAVING ACTUALLY
THREE MACRO LAYERS, IF YOU WILL,
OF A STACK. AND THEY'RE ALL
EQUALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE ARE
INVESTING IN ALL THREE OF THEM.
SO THE BOTTOM LAYER IS USED TO
TRAIN FOUNDATION MODELS, OTHER
AND LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, FMS,
WE'LL CALL THEM AND TO RUN THESE
MODELS IN PRODUCTION, THE MIDDLE
LAYER PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE LMS
AND OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
YOU NEED AND ALL THE TOOLS THAT
YOU NEED TO BUILD AND SCALE
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
THEM. AND THEN AT THE TOP LAYER,
WE'VE GOT APPLICATIONS THAT ARE
BUILT USING FMS SO THAT YOU CAN
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GENERATIVE AI
QUICKLY WITHOUT EVEN NEEDING ANY
SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE. SO LET'S
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LAYER
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WITH, WITH,
WITH THE FOUNDATION MODELS,
THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF
WORKLOADS TRAINING AND INFERENCE
AND TRAINING IS TO CREATE AND
PROVE FMS BY LEARNING PATTERNS
FROM LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRAINING,
DATA AND INFERENCE. USE THAT TO
RUN THE MODELS IN PRODUCTION TO
GENERATE AN OUTPUT SUCH AS TEXT
OR IMAGES OR VIDEO. AND THESE
WORKLOADS CONSUME MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF COMPUTE POWER. SO TO
MAKE GENAI GENAI USE CASES
ECONOMICAL AND FEASIBLE, ALL YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR TRAINING, YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR INFERENCE ON
INCREDIBLY PERFORMANT, COST
EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR ML AND AI. NOW
GPUS ARE THE CHIPS THAT CAN
PERFORM A HIGH VOLUME OF
MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS,
SIMULTANEOUS ALI MAKING THEM
POPULAR FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT
WORKLOADS FROM ML SIMULATIONS,
3D RENDERING. AND WE'VE BEEN
COLLABORATING WITH NVIDIA FOR
OVER 13 YEARS TO BRING GPUS TO
THE CLOUD BUILT ON COMPUTE
INSTANCES THAT SUPPORT A WIDE
RANGE OF USE CASES, INCLUDING
GRAPH SIX GAMING HPC, MACHINE
LEARNING, AND NOW OF COURSE
DEMAND AND GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS. IN 2010, AWS WAS THE
FIRST TO BRING NVIDIA GPUS TO
THE CLOUD WITH KG ONE OR THE
CLUSTER GPU INSTANCE. THEN WE
WERE THE FIRST TO OFFER NVIDIA V
100 GPUS WITH OUR P THREE
INSTANCES AND THEN WE WERE AGAIN
THE FIRST TO OFFER THE A 100
TENSOR CORE GPUS WITH OUR P FOUR
INSTANCES IN PRODUCTION AND
EARLIER THIS YEAR, YES, WE WERE
THE FIRST MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER
TO BRING NVIDIA H100 GPUS TO
MARKET WITH OUR P FIVE INSTANCES
AND THE P FIVE ARE PROVIDING
AMAZING PERFORMANCE FOR
TRAINING. THEY'RE UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER AND 40% LESS
EXPENSIVE THAN P FOUR SECONDS.
NOW HAVING THE BEST CHIPS IS
GREAT AND NECESSARY, BUT TO
DELIVER THE NEXT LEVEL OF
PERFORMANCE, YOU NEED MORE THAN
JUST THE BEST GPUS. YOU ALSO
NEED REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE
CLUSTERS OF SERVERS THAT ARE
RUNNING THESE GPUS. OUR GPU
INSTANCES CAN BE DEPLOYED IN EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH UP TO 3200
GIGABITS PER SECOND OF
NETWORKING THROUGH OUR ELASTIC
FABRIC ADAPTER OR EFA. AND THIS
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
20,000 GPUS IN A SINGLE CLUSTER
FOR PROVIDING UP TO 20 EXAFLOPS
OF AGGREGATE COMPUTE COMPUTE
CAPACITY, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO
A SUPERCOMPUTER. AND ALL OF OUR
GPU INSTANCES THAT ARE RELEASED
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS ARE BASED
ON OUR BREAKTHROUGH NITRO
SYSTEM, WHICH REINVENT NOTED
VIRTUALIZATION BY OFFLOADING
STORAGE AND NETWORKING TO
SPECIALIZED CHIPS SO THAT ALL OF
THE SERVICE COMPUTE IS DEDICATED
TO RUNNING YOUR WORKLOADS. AND
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT OTHER
CLOUD PROVIDERS CAN OFFER. AGAIN
NOW WITH NITRO THIS DELIVERS
PERFORMANCE INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM BARE METAL, BUT AT A LOWER
PRICE. AND THE NITRO SYSTEM ALSO
PROVIDES ENHANCED SECURITY THAT
CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS AND
PROTECTS AND VERIFIES THAT THE
INSTANCE HARDWARE AND FIRMWARE
ARE ALL ROBUST. WE'VE WORKED
CLOSELY WITH NVIDIA TO INTEGRATE
OUR NETWORKING AND OUR
VIRTUALIZATION CAPABILITIES WITH
THEIR CHIPS TO BRING OUR GPU
INSTANCES TO CUSTOMERS AND TODAY
I'M THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE
ARE EXPANDING OUR PARTNERSHIP
WITH NVIDIA WITH MORE
INNOVATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO
DELIVER THE MOST ADVANCED
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS WITH, WITH WITH GPUS
AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE JENSEN
HUANG, FOUNDER AND CEO OF NVIDIA
HERE ON STAGE WITH US TO TELL US
MORE. KALLEL JENSEN, SO GOOD TO
SEE YOU. I'M THRILLED TO BE
HERE. YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US TODAY. IT'S
AMAZING. SO AS I'VE JUST
DISCUSSED, WE'VE GOT A LONG
PARTNERSHIP. AWS NVIDIA. I'VE
BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME
TOGETHER AND I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT HOW THE TEAMS ARE
COLLABORATING. YOU AND I WERE
TALKING ABOUT THAT BACKSTAGE.
THE COLLABORATION IS AMAZING.
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LOT OF
YEARS AND I'M JUST THRILLED TO
DEEPEN THE PARTNERSHIP. THANK
YOU. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. I'M
THRILLED TO BE HERE TO CELEBRATE
THE AMAZING WORK OF OUR TWO
TEAMS AND TO HELP ANNOUNCE OUR
BIG NEW PARTNERSHIP. YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR
A VERY LONG TIME. IN FACT, AWS
WAS THE WORLD'S FIRST CLOUD TO
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GPU
ACCELERATED COMPUTING. AND YOU
PUT THE WORLD'S FIRST GPUS IN
THE CLOUD A LONG TIME AGO. AND
SINCE THEN, THIS IS AN AMAZING
STATISTIC. SIX IN THE LAST
SEVERAL YEARS ALONE, JUST FOR
THE AMPERE AND HOPPER GENERATION
WE'VE PUT UP DEPLOYED BOYD TO
MILNE, XEON CPUS IN AWS THAT'S
THREE Z FLOPS. 3000 EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER HOURS MOST YEAH
EXACTLY. YEAH MOST NATIONS WILL
BE HAPPY WITH ONE EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER AND AWS HAS 3000
OF THEM AND WE ARE JUST JUST
GETTING STARTED. I'M DELIGHTED
TO SEE THAT WE ARE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE TODAY A DEPLOYMENT OF A
WHOLE NEW FAMILY OF GPUS, THE L4
, THE L4 IS AND THE BRAND NEW H
200, THE H 200. THIS IS REALLY
AMAZING THING. THE COMBINATION
BETWEEN THE BRAND NEW TENSOR LLM
OPTIMIZING COMPILERS FOR
GENERATIVE AI AND H 200 IMPROVES
THE THROUGHPUT OF IN INFERENCE
LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL INFERENCE
BY A FACTOR OF FOUR REDUCING THE
COST IN JUST ONE YEAR BY A
FACTOR OF FOUR. NOW OUR
COLLABORATION STARTS WITH, OF
COURSE GREAT GPUS AND WE'RE
RAMPING SO INCREDIBLY FAST EACH
QUARTER. WE'RE STANDING UP AND
DEPLOYING MORE THAN ONE SET OF
FLOPS. MORE FOR AN AWS ONE XEN
OF FLOPS MORE EACH QUARTER. IT'S
AN UNBELIEVABLE NUMBER AND ALL
OF THIS IS, OF COURSE, MADE
POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE
ACCELERATED COMPUTING LIBRARIES.
OUR TWO TEAMS STOOD UP A WHOLE
BUNCH OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT
WE'RE ALSO BRINGING OUR MOST
POPULAR LIBRARIES, THE NVIDIA,
AI STACK, OUR NEMO LLM LARGE
LANGUAGE MODEL FRAMEWORK. THE
RETRIEVER FOR INFERENCE MODEL
FOR RAGS, OUR BIO NEMO DIGITAL
BIOLOGY, LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
FOUNDATION MODELS. ISAAC SIM ON
OMNIVERSE FOR ROBOTICS. THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT AMAZON ROBOTICS
USES TO SIMULATE ITS ROBOTS AND
ITS INCREDIBLE WAREHOUSES THAT
YOU GUYS DO. JUST ALL OF THESE
STACKS, SOFTWARE STACKS AND
LIBRARIES WE'RE GOING TO
INTEGRATE INTO AWS. SO OUR TWO
TEAMS HAVE BEEN REALLY, REALLY
BUSY. BUSY INDEED. AND THAT WAS
A LOT OF THAT WAS A LOT OF
ZETAS. AND EVERYTHING. YEAH. SO
AS YOU SAID, THE COLLABORATION
IS GOING TO ENABLE DEVELOPERS TO
ACCESS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY AND
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED IT TO
INNOVATE WITH GENERATIVE AI. NOW
THE ONE OF THE BIG
ANNOUNCEMENTS, OF COURSE, IS
THAT AWS IS GOING TO BE THE
FIRST CLOUD PROVIDER TO BRING
THE LATEST NVIDIA 200
GRACE-HOPPER SUPER CHIPS WITH A
NEW MULTI-NODE NVLINK TO THE
CLOUD FIRST PLACE. AND MAYBE YOU
CAN TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT THAT AND WHAT MAKES THAT
COMPUTING PLATFORM SO POWERFUL
AND HOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER
TO INTRODUCE IT. WELL, WE'RE
BOTH REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT ARM
PROCESSORS AND THE REASON WHY
ARM IS SO INCREDIBLE IS BECAUSE
WE CAN WE CAN MOLD IT TO EXACTLY
THE TYPE OF COMPUTING NEEDS THAT
WE HAVE. IT'S INCREDIBLY LOW
ENERGY. IT'S INCREDIBLY COST
EFFECTIVE. AND SO GRACE-HOPPER,
WHICH IS GX 200, CONNECTS TWO
REVOLUTIONARY PROCESSORS
TOGETHER IN A REALLY UNIQUE WAY.
IT CONNECTS THEM TOGETHER USING
A CHIP TO CHIP INTERCONNECT
CALLED NVLINK AT ONE TERABYTE
BYTES PER SECOND, AND IT'S
CONNECTED IN A COHERENT WAY SO
THAT THE GPU CAN ACCESS ALL OF
THE CPU'S MEMORY. THE CPU CAN
ACCESS ALL OF THE GPU'S MEMORY
AND SO THE TWO OF THESE
PROCESSORS COULD WORK HAND IN
HAND IN A REALLY FAST WAY. THE
SECOND THING THAT WE DID WAS WE
INVENTED A NEW WAY OF EXTENDING
NVLINK TO A VERY LARGE DOMAIN.
SO NOW 32 GRACE HOPPERS COULD BE
CONNECTED BY A BRAND NEW NVLINK
SWITCH, AND THAT BECOMES ONE
UNIT. AND WITH THE NITRO AWS
NITRO THAT BECOMES BASICALLY ONE
GIANT VIRTUAL GPU INSTANCE. I
MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE
THIS. YOU'VE GOT 30 2H2
HUNDREDS. INCREDIBLE HORSEPOWER
IN ONE VIRTUAL INSTANCE BECAUSE
OF AWS NITRO. AND THEN WE
CONNECT IT WITH AWS, EFA YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY FAST NETWORKING ING
ALL OF THESE UNITS NOW CAN
CREATE INTO A ULTRA CLUSTER AND
AWS GLUE CLUSTER. SO I CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE ALL THIS COME
TOGETHER. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE COMBINATION.
I MEAN, HOW CUSTOMERS ARE GOING
TO USE THIS STUFF. ONE CAN ONLY
IMAGINE AND I KNOW THAT THE TH
TWO HUNDREDS ARE REALLY GOING TO
SUPERCHARGE WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE
DOING. IT'S GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE OF COURSE, IN EC2
INSTANCES COMING SOON. NOW IN
THE WORLD OF GENERATIVE AI, A
LOT OF COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO,
UH, TO ONBOARD AI INTO THEIR
BUSINESS AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE
THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT IT
EXTENDS TO THE SOFTWARE, THE
SERVICES AND ALL OF THE OTHER
WORKFLOWS THAT THEY HAVE. SO
THIS LEADS OF COURSE, TO THE
SECOND BIG ANNOUNCEMENT WE HAVE
TODAY. SO PARTNERING NVIDIA TO
BRING THE NVIDIA DGX CLOUD TO
AWS AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE DGX
CLOUD IS IMPORTANT PLATFORM FOR
CUSTOMERS. WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
DGX CLOUD IS NVIDIA'S AI
FACTORY. THIS IS HOW OUR
RESEARCHERS ADVANCE AI. WE USE
AI TO DO NEURAL GRAPHICS. THE
WAY WE DO COMPUTER GRAPHICS
TODAY IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT AI.
WE USE AI TO ADVANCE. WE USE OUR
AI FACTORIES TO ADVANCE OUR
DIGITAL BIOLOGY MODELS, OUR
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS USE IT FOR
ROBOTICS, FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS.
WE USE IT TO SIMULATE EARTH, TO
A DIGITAL TWIN OF THE EARTH, TO
PREDICT WEATHER AND CLIMATE. IT
AND SO THE CLOUD IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO US. WE'RE
INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BUILD THE
LARGEST AI FACTORY NVIDIA HAS
EVER BUILT. WE'RE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE INSIDE OUR COMPANY WE
CALL IT PROJECT CIBA CIBA. YOU
ALL PROBABLY KNOW SINCE YOU'RE
AT A CONFERENCE IS THE LARGEST,
MOST MAGNIFICENT TREE IN THE
AMAZON. WE CALL IT PROJECT CIBA.
CIBA IS GOING TO BE 16,000 AND
16,384 GPUS CONNECTED INTO ONE
GIANT AI SUPERCOMPUTER. FOR THIS
IS UTTERLY INCREDIBLE. WE WILL
BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE TRAINING
TIME OF THE LARGEST LANGUAGE
MODELS. THE NEXT GENERATION
MOISES THESE LARGE EXTREMELY
LARGE MIXTURE MIXTURE OF
EXPERTS, MODELS AND BE ABLE TO
TRAIN IT IN JUST HALF OF THE
TIME, ESSENTIALLY REDUCE THE
COST OF TRAINING IN JUST ONE
YEAR IN HALF. NOW WE'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO TRAIN MUCH, MUCH
LARGER MULTI-MODAL MO MODELS
THIS NEXT GENERATION, LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS, THESE 16,000
GPUS WILL BE 65 EXAFLOPS. IT'S
LIKE 65 EXASCALE SUPERCOMPUTERS
IN ONE. AND SO I CAN'T WAIT FOR
US TO STAND THIS UP. OUR AI
RESEARCHERS ARE CHOMPING AT THE
BIT. NOW, OF COURSE, THIS IS
ALSO A PLACE WHERE WE
COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS AND
CUSTOMERS WHO NEED TO BUILD
CUSTOM AI MODELS. YOU KNOW, IT'S
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO USE OFF THE
SHELF MODELS AND THERE'S BE A
WHOLE BUNCH OF OFF THE SHELF
MODELS IN PUBLIC CLOUDS. IT'S
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN A
SOFTWARE PLATFORM. COMPANIES,
SAAS COMPANIES, FOR EXAMPLE,
SALESFORCE THAT YOU MENTIONED
EARLIER, THEY'LL HAVE ALL KINDS
OF OFF THE SHELF COPILOTS AND
GENERATIVE AI MODELS. BUT A LOT
OF COMPANIES NEED TO BUILD THEIR
OWN PROPRIETARY MODELS. AND SO
WE SET UP THE AI FACTORY. SO
THAT WE COULD PARTNER WITH THEM
TO HELP THEM CREATE THEIR CUSTOM
AIS, AND NOW THEY'LL RUN ALL ON
AWS. WE'LL DEVELOP THE MODEL ON
AWS, COLLABORATE WITH OUR
CUSTOMERS ON AWS, CONNECT THEM
ALL TO YOUR SERVICES AND STORAGE
SERVICES, SECURITY SERVICES AND
ALL KINDS OF OTHER GENERATIVE AI
SERVICES AND THEN DEPLOY IT ALL
IN AWS. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO DO THIS VERY FIRST TIME
IN AWS. IT'S ALL AMAZING. I
MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING
AMAZING THINGS. WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD TO SEE US COME
TOGETHER EVEN MORE TIGHTLY. I
MEAN, IT'S JUST GOING TO BRING
INCREDIBLE BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS
WHO ARE REALLY GOING TO NEED IT.
WE APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION,
APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU AND
LOOK FORWARD TO A LOT MORE OF
THAT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU,
ADAM. THANK YOU. JENSEN. HAVE A
GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. IT'S BEEN
A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. WE REALLY
APPRECIATED IT. NOW LET'S TALK
ABOUT CAPACITY OR ACTUALLY
GETTING ACCESS TO ALL OF THAT
AMAZING COMPUTE. SO CUSTOMERS
WHO WANT TO BUILD AND TRAIN
MODELS OFTEN NEED LARGE AMOUNTS
OF RELIABLE CLUSTERED CAPACITY.
IT HAS TO BE TOGETHER OR IN
CLUSTERS, BUT THEY DON'T
NECESSARILY NEED THE SAME AMOUNT
OF IT ALL THE TIME.
FOR EXAMPLE, CUSTOMERS TRAINING A MODEL. I
MEAN, THEY MIGHT STOP TO
EVALUATE NEWS, USE NEW TRAINING
DATA OR MAKE OTHER CHANGES, AND
THEN THEY WANT TO DO MORE
TRAINING. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS
THAT THEY OFTEN NEED SHORT TERM
CLUSTERED CAPACITY AND IT'S
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NO ONE, NO
CLOUD HAS BEEN ADDRESSING UNTIL
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
FOR ML AND EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
WERE THE FIRST CONSUMPTION MODEL
IN THE INDUSTRY THAT ENABLES ANY
CUSTOMER TO RESERVE THE HIGHLY
SOUGHT AFTER GPU CAPACITY TO RUN
FOR SHORT DURATION MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS. AND THIS
ELIMINATES THE NEED TO HOLD ON
TO THE CAPACITY HOLDING CAPACITY
THAT THEY'RE USING JUST SO THEY
CAN BE CERTAIN THAT THEY CAN USE
IT LATER IF THEY NEED TO USE IT
LATER. NOW EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
ARE DEPLOYED IN ULTRACLUSTERS
INTERCONNECTED WITH OUR EFA
NETWORKING THAT WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THIS MORNING AND THAT
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
HUNDREDS OF GPUS IN A SINGLE
CLUSTER WITH THIS NEW OFFERING.
SO WITH THE CAPACITY BLOCKS,
CUSTOMERS CAN PLAN FOR THEIR ML
WORKLOAD DEPLOYMENTS WITH
CERTAINTY AND THEY KNOW THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE GPU
CAPACITY WHEN THEY NEED IT AND
ONLY WHEN THEY NEED IT. NOW
SUPPORT FOR THE LATEST
GENERATION. HIGH PERFORMANCE
GPUS COMBINED WITH OUR
INNOVATIONS, VIRTUALIZATION,
NETWORKING, CLUSTER MANAGEMENT.
THESE ARE REASONS WHY AWS IS THE
BEST PLACE TO RUN GPUS IN THE
WORLD, BUT TO DRIVE INNOVATION
AND THE BROAD CHOICES THAT OUR
CUSTOMERS WANT IN ML AND AI, WE
REALIZED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT
AGAIN HERE IS ANOTHER PLACE WE'D
HAVE TO INNOVATE ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO THE SILICON, JUST LIKE
WE DID WITH GRAVITON FOR GENERAL
PURPOSE COMPUTING AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT TRAINIUM AND INFERENTIA
. SO TRAINIUM IS OUR PURPOSE
BUILT CHIP FOR TRAINING, MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS, MACHINE
LEARNING MODELS AND INFERENTIA
IS OUR CHIP OPTIMIZED FOR
RUNNING INFERENCE ON THOSE
MODELS? SO EARLIER THIS YEAR WE
ALREADY ANNOUNCED THE SECOND
GENERATION OF OUR INFERENTIA
CHIP INFERENTIA TO AND BECAUSE
WE OPTIMIZE FOR INFERENCE, THE
TWO INSTANCES POWERED BY
INFERENTIA TO ARE OFFER THE BEST
LOWEST COST INFERENCE IN EC2
WHILE ALSO DELIVERING UP TO FOUR
TIMES HIGHER THROUGHPUT AND TEN
TIMES LOWER LATENCY COMPARED TO
THE INF1 INSTANCES. CUSTOMERS
LIKE ADOBE, DEUTSCHE TELEKOM,
LEONARDO, AI, THEY'VE ALL SEEN
GREAT EARLY RESULTS AND THEY ARE
DEPLOYING THEIR GENERATIVE AI AI
MODELS AT SCALE WITH INFERENTIA
TO. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF
INTEREST IN TRAINIUM AS WELL.
OUR TRN1 INSTANCES POWERED BY
TRAINIUM HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED BY A
LOT OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
ANTHROPIC PARTNERS LIKE
DATABRICKS AND RICOH AND OUR OWN
AMAZON SEARCH TEAM USES TRN1
INSTANCES TO TRAIN TRAIN A
LARGE, DEEP, LARGE SCALE, DEEP
LEARNING MODELS. THEY'RE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF A TRAINIUM HIGH
PERFORMANCE SCALE RELIABILITY
AND LOW COST. BUT AS CUSTOMERS
CONTINUE TO TRAIN BIGGER AND
BIGGER MODELS ON LARGER AND
LARGER DATA SETS, WE REALIZED WE
NEEDED TO KEEP PUSHING AND
PUSHING OUR PRICE PERFORMANCE.
WE'RE NEVER DONE THERE. AND
TODAY I'M REALLY EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE AWS TRAINIUM TO OUR
SECOND GENERATION. IT'S OUR
SECOND GENERATION CHIP. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR HIGH
PERFORMANCE TRAINING OF
FOUNDATION MODELS, TRAINING IS
DESIGNED TO DELIVER UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO OUR FIRST GENERATION
CHIPS AND THAT MAKES IT IDEAL
FOR TRAINING FOUNDATION MODELS
WITH HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OR
EVEN TRILLIONS OF PARAMETERS.
TRAINIUM TWO IS GOING TO POWER
THE NEXT GENERATION OF EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND WILL DELIVER
UP TO 65 EXAFLOPS OF AGGREGATE
COMPUTE AND WE EXPECT THE FIRST
TRAINIUM TWO BASED INSTANCES ARE
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR
AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO DO
WITH THEM. MEANWHILE ALL A LOT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS ARE
STILL JUST TALKING ABOUT THEIR
OWN. ML CHIPS. WE'VE ALSO MADE A
LOT OF EXCITING PROGRESS IN
BUILDING THE SOFTWARE TOOLCHAIN
THAT SUPPORTS TRAINIUM IN
INFERENTIA. SO AWS NEURON IS OUR
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT THAT
HELPS CUSTOMERS GET MAXIMUM
PERFORMANCE FROM ML CHIPS. NEW
RON SUPPORTS MACHINE LEARNING
FRAMEWORKS LIKE TENSORFLOW
PYTORCH WITH JAX SUPPORT COMING
REALLY SOON AND SO CUSTOMERS CAN
USE THEIR EXISTING KNOWLEDGE TO
BUILD TRAINING AND INFERENCE
PIPELINES WITH JUST A FEW LINES
OF CODE AND NEURON SUPPORTS THE
MOST POPULAR MODELS, INCLUDING
93 OF THE TOP 100 AND COUNTING.
IMPORTANTLY, YOU ALSO NEED THE
RIGHT TOOLS TO HELP TRAIN AND
DEPLOY YOUR MODELS AND THIS IS
WHY WE HAVE AMAZON SAGEMAKER OUR
MANAGED SERVICE. THAT MAKES IT
EASY FOR DEVELOPERS TO TRAIN,
TUNE, BUILD, MANAGE MACHINE
LEARNING AND FOUNDATION MODELS.
IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE WE
LAUNCHED SAGEMAKER, WE'VE
INTRODUCED A LOT OF POWERFUL
INNOVATIONS LIKE AUTOML MODEL
TUNING, DISTRIBUTED TRAINING,
FLEXIBLE MODEL DEPLOYMENT TOOLS
FOR ML OPS AND BUILT IN FEATURES
LIKE RESPONSIBLE AI. SAGEMAKER
HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN
DEMOCRATIZING ML FOR TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING STABILITY AI AI21LABS
LABS, THOMSON REUTERS,
ASTRAZENECA, 3M, HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AWS,
FERRARI AND MORE, AND SAGEMAKER
CAN TRAIN MODELS WITH UP TO
BILLIONS OF PARAMETERS FOR
EXAMPLE, TI HAS TRAINED 180
BILLION PARAMETER FALCON FM,
WHICH IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MODEL ON
SAGEMAKER USING 3000 GPUS AND
PETABYTES OF PETABYTES OF DATA
STORED IN S3. AND YOU CAN ALSO
DEPLOY THIS TOP RANKED MODEL
USING SAGEMAKER. WE'VE ALSO BEEN
WORKING CLOSELY WITH HUGGINGFACE
TO SUPPORT THEIR MODELS ON
SAGEMAKER AND HAVE COLLABORATED
TO CREATE THE HUGGING FACE DEEP
LEARNING CONTAINERS TO HELP
ACCELERATE TRAINING AND
DEPLOYMENT OF FMS USING
SAGEMAKER, TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA. SO IF YOU'RE
BUILDING YOUR OWN MODELS. AWS IS
RELENTLESSLY FOCUSED ON
EVERYTHING YOU NEED THE BEST
CHIPS, THE MOST ADVANCED
VIRTUALIZATION, POWERFUL
PETABYTE SCALE NETWORKING
CAPABILITIES, HYPER SCALE
CLUSTERING AND THE RIGHT TOOLS
TO HELP YOU BUILD. BUT OF
COURSE, AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF
ORGANIZATIONS JUST WANT TO BE
ABLE TO ACCESS THE MOST POWERFUL
MODELS OUT THERE. THEY WANT TO
GET STARTED QUICKLY,
EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT FMS
AND TESTING DIFFERENT USE CASES
AND TO MEET THE ENORMOUS
OPPORTUNITY HEAD ON. BUT THEY
ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH
MODEL SHOULD I EVEN USE AND HOW
DO I DECIDE WHICH ARE BEST FOR
MY APPLICATION? TITAN HOW CAN I
MOVE QUICKLY TO BUILD AND DEPLOY
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS? JENS
AND HOW CAN I KEEP MY DATA
SECURE AND PRIVATE? THAT'S WHY
WE'RE INVESTING IN THAT MIDDLE
LAYER OF THE STACK. SO NOW WE
KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU NEED IT TO
BE EASIER TO ACCESS A POWERFUL
AND DIVERSE SET OF MODELS. LMS
OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS, AND
THEN TO QUICKLY BUILD
APPLICATIONS WITH THEM ALL THE
TIME, MAINTAINING YOUR SECURITY
AND PRIVACY AND THAT'S WHY WE
BUILT AMAZON BEDROCK SO BEDROCK
IS THE EASIEST WAY TO BUILD AND
SCALE GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS
FOR LMS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS AND CUSTOMERS IN EVERY
INDUSTRY ARE ALREADY USING
BEDROCK TO REINVENT THEIR USER
EXPERIENCES, THEIR PRODUCTS AND
THEIR PROCESSES, AND TO BRING AI
INTO THE HEART OF THEIR
BUSINESSES. SO WHY BEDROCK? SO
FIRST, YOU ENJOY THE BROADEST
CHOICE OF MODELS, MANY OF WHICH
ARE AVAILABLE FIRST OR IN SOME
CASES ONLY ON BEDROCK YOU CAN
ADD YOUR OWN BUSINESS CONTEXT
QUICKLY, EASILY AND PRIVATELY
WITH THE BROADEST SELECTION OF
CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS AND YOU
GET ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
AND PRIVACY. BECAUSE WE DESIGNED
IT THAT WAY FROM DAY ONE. AND
THE CUSTOMER EXCITEMENT HAS BEEN
OVERWHELMING. WE MADE THE
SERVICE GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN
SEPTEMBER AND NOW OVER 10,000
CUSTOMERS ARE USING BEDROCK
AROUND THE WORLD ACROSS
VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY, ADIDAS
HAS ENABLING DEVELOPERS TO GET
QUICK, ACCURATE ANSWERS TO DEEP
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, AS CARRIER
IS USING BEDROCK TO COMBINE
HISTORICAL ACTIONS, PREDICTIVE
ANALYTICS SYSTEMS, ALERTS AND
DATA TRENDS TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THESE ARE
HELPING CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR
ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CUT
CARBON EMISSIONS. NASDAQ IS
USING BEDROCK TO AUTOMATE
INVESTIGATIVE WORKFLOWS ON
SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS AND TO
STRENGTHEN THEIR ANTI ANTI
FINANCIAL CRIME AND SURVEILLANCE
CAPABILITIES. SO MANY MORE,
INCLUDING BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES, CLARIANT COX
AUTOMOTIVE, GODADDY. LEXISNEXIS.
MERCK OMNICOM GROUP ARE ALL
USING BEDROCK. THEY'RE ALL USING
IT TO BUILD GENAI APPLICATIONS.
TODAY BUT IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS.
EVERY ONE IS MOVING FAST,
EXPERIMENTING AND LEARNING. AND
AT THE SAME TIME, THE GENERATIVE
AI TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IS EVOLVING
QUICKLY WITH NEW DEVELOPMENTS
PRACTICALLY EVERY DAY AND
CUSTOMERS ARE FINDING THAT
DIFFERENT MODELS ACTUALLY WORK
BETTER FOR DIFFERENT USE CASES
OR ON DIFFERENT SETS OF DATA.
SOME MODELS ARE GREAT FOR
SUMMARIZATION, OTHERS ARE GOOD
FOR REASONING AND INTEGRATION,
AND STILL OTHERS HAVE AWESOME
LANGUAGE SUPPORT. AND THEN
THERE'S IMAGE GENERATION IN
SEARCH USE CASES AND MORE, ALL
COMING FROM BOTH PROPRIETARY
MODELS AND MODELS THAT ARE
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY.
I MEAN, THINGS ARE MOVING SO
FAST AND IN THAT TYPE OF
ENVIRONMENT THAT THE ABILITY TO
ADAPT IS THE MOST VALUABLE
CAPABILITY THAT YOU CAN HAVE.
THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE
MODEL TO RULE THEM ALL, AND
THERE'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE ONE COMPANY PROVIDING THE
MODELS THAT EVERYBODY USES. SO
YOU DON'T WANT A CLOUD PROVIDER
WHO'S BEHOLDEN PRIMARILY TO ONE
MODEL PROVIDER. YOU NEED TO BE
TRYING OUT DIFFERENT MODELS. YOU
NEED TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH
BETWEEN THEM RAPIDLY OR EVEN
COMBINING THEM WITH THE SAME USE
CASES. AND YOU NEED A REAL
CHOICE OF MODEL PROVIDERS AS YOU
DECIDE WHO'S GOT THE BEST
TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO WHO HAS THE
DEPENDABILITY THAT YOU NEED IN A
BUSINESS PARTNER. I THINK THE
EVENTS OF THE PAST TEN DAYS HAVE
MADE THAT VERY CLEAR. WE'VE BEEN
CONSISTENT ABOUT THIS NEED FOR
CHOICE FOR THE WHOLE HISTORY OF
AWS, AND THAT'S THE APPROACH
THAT WE CLEARLY LAID OUT WHEN WE
STARTED TALKING ABOUT OUR
GENERATIVE AI STRATEGY ALMOST A
YEAR AGO. AND THAT'S WHY WE
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE, TO MAKE
BUILDING AND MOVING BETWEEN A
RANGE OF FOUNDATION MODELS AS
EASY AS AN API CALL. TODAY
BEDROCK PROVIDES ACCESS TO A
WIDE RANGE OF MODELS FROM
LEADERS LIKE I. 21 ANTHROPIC
COHERE STABILITY AI, AS WELL AS
AMAZON'S OWN AMAZON TITAN MODELS
. BUT WE DIDN'T STOP THERE. WE
WERE THE FIRST TO MAKE METIS
LLAMA 2 MODEL AVAILABLE THROUGH
A FULLY MANAGED API. AND WE ALSO
RECENTLY ANNOUNCED OUR EXPANDED
COLLABORATION WITH ANTHROPIC. SO
ANTHROPIC IS A LONG TIME AWS
CUSTOMER AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S
LEADING FOUNDATION MODEL
PROVIDERS. THEIR MODELS CLAUDE
AND THEY GOT OTHERS AS WELL
EXCEL AT A WIDE RANGE OF TASKS
FROM SOPHISTICATED DIALOG AND
CREATIVE CONTENT GENERATION TO
COMPLEX REASONING AND DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS. SO AS PART OF THE
COLLABORATION, ANTHROPIC IS
GOING TO USE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA TO TRAIN FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF THEIR MODELS AND
BEDROCK CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO
HAVE EARLY ACCESS, NOT AVAILABLE
ON OTHER CLOUDS TO UNIQUE
FEATURES FOR MODEL CUSTOMIZATION
AND FINE TUNING CAPABILITIES. SO
TO DIG IN ON WHAT WE'RE DOING
WITH ANTHROPIC, I'D LIKE TO
BRING OUT OUR PARTNER DARIO
OMODEI, WHO'S THE CEO AND
CO-FOUNDER OF ANTHROPIC. LET'S
GIVE HIM A HAND. AS WELL. ALL
RIGHT. WE HAVE CHAIRS. LET'S SIT
. DARIO THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. YEAH.
EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
CLAUDE IS AVAILABLE ON BEDROCK,
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT,
LET'S JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS ABOUT
AND WHAT MAKES CLAUDE SO UNIQUE.
YES SO ANTHROPIC WAS FOUNDED ON
THE IDEA THAT WE CAN MAKE AI
MODELS THAT ARE SAFE, RELIABLE
AND STEERABLE WHILE STILL BEING
HIGHLY CAPABLE. THE FOUNDERS OF
ANTHROPIC WERE A SET OF PEOPLE
WHO WORKED AT OPENAI FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. WE DEVELOPED IDEAS LIKE
GPT THREE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK, SCALING
LAWS FOR LANGUAGE MODELS. SOME
OF THE KEY IDEAS BEHIND THE
CURRENT GENERATIVE AI BOOM.
SEVEN OF US LEFT AND FOUNDED
ANTHROPIC, OUR FOUNDATION MODEL
CLAUDE. IN ADDITION TO BEING
SAFE AND RELIABLE, EXCELS AT A
LOT OF KNOWLEDGE WORK TASKS LIKE
CONTENT, GENERATION,
SUMMARIZATION, Q&A, COMPLEX
REASONING, THINGS LIKE THAT. WE
HAVE AN INDUSTRY LEADING CONTEXT
WINDOW OF 200 K TOKENS. THAT'S
ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH MAKES
IT WELL SUITED FOR AREAS LIKE
LEGAL FINANCE, INSURANCE,
CODING, THINGS LIKE THAT. AND
ABOUT HALF OF THE FORTUNE 500
ARE USING OR ARE TESTING CLAUDE.
SO AMAZING PROGRESS. SO JUST A
FEW MONTHS AGO, OBVIOUSLY AMAZON
AND ANTHROPIC ANNOUNCED KIND OF
AN ENHANCED STRATEGIC
COLLABORATION ANTHROPIC NAMED
AWS IS YOUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO
BE TRAINING AND DEPLOYING FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF CLAUDE AND
FOUNDATION MODELS ON AWS. SO
JUST TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT LED
UP TO THIS AND HOW THAT
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANTHROPIC
AND AWS GROW? YEAH. SO ANTHROPIC
USE OF AWS GOES BACK TO OUR
EARLY HISTORY BACK ALL THE WAY
IN THE MIDST OF TIME IN 2021. WE
CAN REMEMBER THAT, RIGHT? WE
TRAINED OUR FIRST. WE TRAINED
OUR FIRST MODEL ON AWS. AND SO
WE'RE EXCITED NOW TO SAY THAT
YOU GUYS ARE OUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS. I WOULD SAY THE
PARTNERSHIP HAS THREE
COMPONENTS. FIRST IS THE COMPUTE
SIDE, WHICH I JUST DISCUSSED,
WHICH WE'VE BEEN DOING
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY. THE SECOND IS ON THE
PROVISION TO CUSTOMER SIDE.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT
AMAZON BEDROCK WE REALLY
RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THAT WE
COULD PROVIDE TO CUSTOMERS
WORKING TOGETHER AND THE THIRD
SIDE IS THE HARDWARE. WE'RE
CURRENTLY WORKING WITH YOU GUYS
TO OPTIMIZE THESE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA FOR OUR USE CASES AND
HOPEFULLY FOR OTHER USE CASES.
AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE
CAN ACHIEVE THAT FOREX FASTER
THAN THE FIRST GENERATION
TRAINIUM THAT YOU JUST
ANNOUNCED. IF WE OPTIMIZE THESE
THINGS TOGETHER. AND SO PUTTING
TOGETHER THESE THREE PIECES,
LAYERS OF THE STACK REALLY
ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE THINGS TO
CUSTOMERS TOGETHER THAT COULDN'T
BE PROVIDED BEFORE THINGS LIKE
CUSTOMIZATION OF MODELS USE OF
PROPRIETARY DATA AND UNIQUE FINE
TUNING FEATURES. WELL, IT'S THE
RESPECT WE HAVE FOR YOU GUYS IS
JUST TREMENDOUS. I MEAN, TRULY
WORLD CLASS EXPERTISE FOR THE
ANTHROPIC TEAM. I'VE REALLY
ENJOYED WORKING TOGETHER AND THE
MODELS ARE JUST SO POWERFUL. SO
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE AIMING TO AND I
THINK WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
IMPROVING AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES THROUGH
THIS COLLABORATION. TITAN AND OF
COURSE OUR OWN AMAZON DEVELOPERS
ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO ANTHROPIC
MODELS ON BEDROCK AND THROUGHOUT
THE COMPANY. AND WE'RE NOT ONLY
WORKING TO PROVIDE HOOD
CUSTOMERS WITH, WITH, WITH THIS,
BUT WE'RE GIVING THEM EARLY
ACCESS TO UNIQUE FEATURES THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
GET ANYWHERE ELSE. AND WE'RE OUT
THERE TOGETHER WITH OUR
GENERATIVE AI INNOVATION CENTER,
WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE
FIELD, HELPING THEM TO ACTUALLY
GET GET TARGETED. AND THAT'S
ALLOWING US, OF COURSE, TO BRING
THIS EXPERTISE AND THE DOMAIN
SPECIFIC EXPERTISE THAT THEY
NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS.
AND AS WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE
TOGETHER AND IT'S BEEN HOT AND
HEAVY, PARTICULARLY THE PAST FEW
WEEKS, BUT BEFORE THAT AS WELL,
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST
INTERESTING USE CASES THAT
YOU'VE SEEN? YEAH SO I'LL GIVE
THREE EXAMPLES ACROSS DIFFERENT
INDUSTRIES. THERE'S MANY OTHERS,
BUT THIS SHOULD GIVE GIVE A
SENSE OF THE RANGE. AND WE WE'VE
SEEN A LOT OF ORGANIC ADOPTION.
ONE EXAMPLE IN THE BIOMEDICAL
SPACE WE'RE HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE
WE'RE WORKING WITH PFIZER. I'M A
FORMER BIOLOGIST MYSELF, SO I'M
REALLY EXCITED FOR ANY WAY I CAN
CAN ADVANCE MEDICAL SCIENCE AND
BRING BRING LIFE SAVING DRUGS TO
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND THE
LEGAL SPACE. WE MADE A CUSTOM
FINE TUNED MODEL, DEPLOYED IT TO
YOU GUYS FOR LEXISNEXIS TO HELP
WITH THEIR LEGAL SEARCH. YOU
KNOW, IN A WAY THAT'S KIND OF
FACT BASED AND PRODUCE CITATIONS
. AND IN THE FINANCE SPACE,
WE'RE WORKING WITH BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES TO DEVELOP AN
INVESTMENT ANALYST, ASSISTANT.
BUT BEYOND THAT, JUST SOME
EXAMPLES. WE'VE ENGAGED WITH
SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF SOME OF THE
LARGEST PLAYERS IN THE INSURANCE
AND BANKING INDUSTRIES AND, YOU
KNOW, COULD TELL SIMILAR STORIES
ABOUT OTHER INDUSTRIES. SO, YOU
KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE
NEW USE CASES AND WHERE ALL OF
THIS GOES. THAT'S INCREDIBLE
MOMENTUM. JUST THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES EXAMPLE TO BE WORKING
WITH WITH THAT MANY LEADERS. SO
JUST LAST WEEK YOU'RE NOT
STANDING STILL, RIGHT. SO JUST
LAST WEEK YOU ANNOUNCED CLAUDE
2.1. SO THAT'S GOT A WHOLE LOT
OF NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN KEY
CAPABLE CITIES. MAYBE YOU CAN
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.
YEAH. SO CLAUDE 2.1 REALLY IS A
RELEASE THAT'S TARGETED AT
ENTERPRISES. SO A FEW DIFFERENT
FEATURES. ONE IS WE'VE DOUBLED
OUR CONTEXT WINDOW TO 200,000
TOKENS. TOKENS IS A TERM OF ART
IN THE AI SPACE. WHAT IT AMOUNTS
TO IS ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH
IS A RELATIVELY LONG BOOK. AND
SO USE CASES LIKE READING
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, READING AN
ENTIRE LONG BOOK. AND ONE OF MY
FAVORITES, PUTTING MULTIPLE
DOCUMENTS IN THE CONTEXT WINDOW
AND ASKING THE MODEL TO COMPARE
THEM OR INTEGRATE THEM. A SECOND
FEATURE IS THAT WE'VE REDUCED
THE RATE OF SO-CALLED
HALLUCINATIONS, WHICH IS WHEN
MODELS SAY THINGS THAT AREN'T
TRUE TO BY BY ABOUT TWO X WE'VE
SEEN ACROSS THE INDUSTRY A CORE
OBSTACLE TO DEPLOYMENT IN THE
ENTERPRISE WORLD IS PEOPLE ARE
WORRIED THAT MODELS WILL SAY
THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE. NO ONE
HAS PERFECTLY SOLVED THIS
PROBLEM, BUT WE ARE REALLY
LEADING THE WAY IN GETTING MORE
AND MORE REDUCTIONS AND THEN WE
ALSO HAVE SOME BETA FEATURES AS
WE'RE INTRODUCING SYSTEM PROMPTS
FOR TOOL USE AS A BETA FEATURE
AND A DEVELOPER WORKBENCH.
AGAIN, ALL TOOLS TARGETED AT
PEOPLE BUILDING FOR ENTERPRISES.
WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE ALL THE USE
CASES THAT EMERGE FROM THIS. I'M
SPEECHLESS. YES, THAT IS SUCH
INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. YES. I
MEAN, YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU
TALKED ABOUT THE REDUCTION OF
HALLUCINATION, A REALLY
IMPORTANT TOPIC. YOU JUST MORE
BROADLY, I THINK WE SHARE A
BELIEF THAT I SHOULD BE SAFE,
SECURE, RESPONSIBLE AND BENEFIT
SOCIETY. AND WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED
A LOT OF GROUPS AND
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROMOTING
THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT
OF RESPONSIBLE AI IN FACT, I
KEEP BUMPING INTO DARIA AROUND
THE WORLD AT SOME OF THESE
VARIOUS GATHERINGS, WHICH IS
NICE. SO I KNOW THIS IS A
PARTICULAR PASSION OF YOURS. AND
CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT ANTHROPIC WORK IN
THIS AREA? YEAH I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING WE
WERE FOUNDED ON AND THAT WE CARE
ABOUT DEEPLY. WE I WOULD
CATEGORIZE IT INTO TWO AREAS
WHERE WE'VE DONE WORK IN THIS
AREA. ONE IS THE WAY WE DESIGN
OUR OWN MODELS AND THE OTHER IS
THE WAY THAT WE TRY TO SET AN
EXAMPLE FOR THE ECOSYSTEM AND
BRING OTHERS ALONG SO THAT
ULTIMATELY EVERYONE BECOMES
SAFER AND MORE RELIABLE. SO
LARGE FRACTION ON THE FIRST ONE,
A LARGE FRACTION OF OUR RESEARCH
ORG WORKS ON SAFETY. WE PUT A
LOT OF WORK INTO MAKING OUR
MODELS HARD TO BREAK, MAKING
THEM SECURE AGAINST MISUSE AND
HARMFUL USE. THERE WAS A RECENT
STUDY OUT OF CARNEGIE MELLON
WHERE PEOPLE TRIED TO
ADVERSARIALLY BREAK DIFFERENT
MODELS AND IT FOUND THAT THEY
WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY BREAK
CLAUDE TEN TIMES LESS OFTEN THAN
THEY WERE ABLE TO BREAK THE
COMPETITOR'S MODEL. SO THERE'S A
REAL DIFFERENCE HERE. A SECOND
WE'VE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO
INTERPRETABILITY SEEING INSIDE
THE MODELS. THERE'S NO
COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENTS ON THAT
SO FAR. BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG ARC
AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT RELATIVELY
SOON FOR BOTH COMPLIANCE AND FOR
UNDERSTANDING WHAT MODELS DO AND
THEREFORE REDUCING BAD BEHAVIOR
FROM THE MODELS, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE
WIDER ECOSYSTEM. YOU KNOW, WE
ALWAYS TRY TO CREATE A RACE TO
THE TOP, DO SOMETHING, AND THEN
COMPETITORS, OTHER PLAYERS IN
THE ECOSYSTEM, FOLLOW ALONG AND
DO THE SAME THING. AN EXAMPLE OF
THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE SCALING
POLICY WHERE WE FRONT LOADED
SAFETY INVESTMENT AHEAD OF MODEL
SCALING, A KIND OF
PRE-DEPLOYMENT TESTING REGIME
LIKE WHAT'S DONE FOR CARS AND
AIRPLANES. AND IN THE POLICY
SPACE, WE'VE CONTINUALLY
ADVOCATED FOR GOVERNMENTS TO
BUILD UP THEIR ABILITY TO
EVALUATE AND MEASURE AI SYSTEMS
AS IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO EVALUATE
AND MEASURE THINGS, WE'LL GET
EITHER NO REGULATION OR POORLY
INFORMED REGULATION. WE NEED TO
ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE CAN DEVELOP QUICKLY,
RESPONSIBLY, BUT IN A WAY THAT'S
SECURE. I JUST LOVE THE CONCEPT
OF THE RACE TO THE TOP. IT'S SO
POSITIVE. AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS SO AMAZING. I MEAN, WE'VE
SAID IT THE WHOLE 17 YEARS THAT
AWS HAS BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES
THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT GIVES US
ENERGY IS JUST WORKING WITH THE
COOLEST, MOST CUTTING EDGE, YOU
KNOW, STARTUPS AND ENTREPRENEURS
IN THE WORLD. AND THERE IS JUST
NO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN GENERATIVE AI NOW.
AND WHAT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS
DOING. SO IT'S GREAT TO BE
PARTNERING TOGETHER SO DEEPLY
AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
JOINING ME HERE ON STAGE TODAY.
YEAH, EXCITED FOR EVERYTHING WE
CAN DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU. ALL
RIGHT.
ALL RIGHTY. SO THAT'S AMAZING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN, DARIA,
FOR COMING OUT AND JOINING US.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. SO THE
INNOVATION AROUND GENERATIVE AI
MODELS IS EXPLOSIVE AND WE
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
WITH ALL OF OUR BEDROCK PARTNERS
FOR YEARS TO COME. INCREDIBLY
INNOVATIVE SPACE. AND WE'RE ALSO
EXCITED ABOUT THE LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS THAT WE'RE BUILDING
OURSELVES AT AMAZON SO OUR
AMAZON TITAN MODELS WERE CREATED
AND PRE-TRAINED BY AWS, AND
WE'RE BUILDING OUR OWN MODELS IN
ORDER TO BRING ACTUALLY A FEW
BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS. SO WE DO
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE HERE. I
MEAN, AMAZON HAS BEEN WORKING ON
AI FOR 25 YEARS. I'VE GOT A LONG
TRACK RECORD. WE USE THE
TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR BUSINESS
AND WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
BUILDING AND DEPLOYING MODELS.
AND AS A RESULT, WE CAN PROVIDE
A WHOLE RANGE OF MODELS THAT
OFFER REALLY POWERFUL
CAPABILITIES AND ALSO GREAT
ECONOMICS TO SUPPORT A WHOLE
BUNCH OF USE CASES AND WE
CAREFULLY CHOOSE HOW WE TRAIN
OUR MODELS AND THE DATA THAT WE
USE TO DO SO. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY
GOING TO INDEMNIFY CUSTOMERS
AGAINST CLAIMS THAT OUR MODELS
OR THEIR OUTPUTS INFRINGE ON
ANYBODY'S COPYRIGHT. NOW, THERE
ARE ALREADY MULTIPLE MODELS IN
THE TITAN FAMILY. WE'VE GOT
TITAN TEXT LITE, WHICH IS IDEAL
FOR TEXT BASED TASKS LIKE
SUMMARIZATION. WE'VE ALSO GOT
TITAN TEXT EXPRESS, WHICH IS
GREAT FOR MORE ADVANCED GENERAL
LANGUAGE TASKS LIKE COPY
EDITING, COPYWRITING AND WE'VE
ALSO GOT THE TITAN TEXT
EMBEDDINGS MODEL FOR SEARCH USE
CASES OR PERSONALIZATION AND
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ADDING
MODELS TO THE TITAN FAMILY. AND
IF YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT, THEN
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TUNE INTO
SWAMI'S KEYNOTE TOMORROW. A
LITTLE, LITTLE WORD UP NOW, ALL
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE
ALL EXTREMELY CAPABLE AND THEY
ALL ENABLE A LOT OF GREAT
APPLICATIONS. BUT TO REALLY
DRIVE YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED
GENERATIVE AI THAT UNDERSTANDS
YOUR BUSINESS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
CUSTOMERS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
PRODUCTS, YOUR OPERATIONS. AND
THAT'S ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN YOU
USE YOUR OWN DATA TO IMPROVE AND
CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS. THE MODELS
HAVE TO BECOME UNIQUE TO YOU. SO
AMAZON BEDROCK IS GIVING YOU ALL
OF THE PURPOSE BUILT
CAPABILITIES THAT YOU NEED TO
CUSTOMIZE THE AI APPLICATIONS
WITH YOUR OWN DATA. SO WITH A
FEW CLICKS YOU CAN GO FROM
GENERIC APPLICATIONS TO ONES
THAT ARE HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND
HIGHLY TAILORED. SO ONE
IMPORTANT TECHNIQUE IS CALLED
FINE TUNING. NOW, WITH FINE
TUNING, YOU POINT THE MODELS TO
EXAMPLES OF DATA IN S3 THAT
YOU'VE LABELED LABELED TO
PROVIDE CONTEXT. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU MIGHT POINT TO PROPOSALS AND
YOU'VE LABELED SOME OF THOSE
PROPOSALS AS STRONG. SO IN THIS
WAY THE MODEL LEARNS FROM YOU,
LEARNS FROM YOUR DATA. WHAT
MATTERS THE MOST TO YOU. AND
THEN BEDROCK MAKES A COPY OF THE
BASE MODELS. IT TRAINS IT, IT
CREATES A PRIVATE FINE TUNED
MODEL SO YOU GET TAILORED
RESPONSES. SO FINE TUNING IS
AVAILABLE IN AMAZON TITAN TEXT
LITE AND EXPRESS, AND TODAY IT'S
ALSO GENERALLY AVAILABLE FOR
COHERE COMMAND LITE AND META
LLAMA 2 AND FINE TUNING IS
COMING TO ANTHROPIC CLAUDE SOON.
SO A SECOND TECHNIQUE FOR
TAILORING TAILORING FOUNDATION
MODELS FOR YOUR BUSINESS IS
CALLED RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED
GENERATION OR RAG ANOTHER ONE OF
THE TERMS YOU SEE OUT THERE A
LOT. SO RAG ALLOWS YOU TO
CUSTOMIZE A MODEL'S RESPONSES
WHEN YOU WANT THE MODEL TO
CONSIDER NEW KNOWLEDGE OR UP TO
DATE INFORMATION. SO BEDROCK
DOES THIS FOR YOU BY CALLING AND
BRINGING BACK YOUR OWN DATA,
YOUR DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES,
INCLUDING DOCUMENT REPOSITORIES,
DATABASES AND OTHER APIS AND
MORE SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MODEL
MIGHT USE RAG TO RETRIEVE SEARCH
RESULTS FROM OUR AMAZON
OPENSEARCH SERVICE OR DOCUMENTS
FROM S3. AND IN SEPTEMBER, WE
INTRODUCED A RAG CAPABILITY
CALLED KNOWLEDGE BASES THAT
CONNECTS FM TO YOUR PROPRIETARY
DATA SOURCES TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR
PROMPTS WITH MORE INFORMATION
AND TODAY KNOWLEDGE BASES IS
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NOW, A
THIRD WAY THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE
MODELS INSIDE OF BEDROCK IS A
TECHNIQUE CALLED CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING. SO CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT
USES LARGE AMOUNTS OF UNLABELED
DATA BEFORE YOU FINE TUNE IT.
YOU DID THE LABELED DATA HERE IS
UNLABELED DATA LIKE THE RAW TEXT
OF INTERNAL REPORTS, FINANCIAL
PLANS OR RESEARCH RESULTS THAT
YOU HAVE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE
USED TO IMPROVE THE MODELS,
KNOWLEDGE AND ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES USING THINGS IN
YOUR OWN SPECIFIC DOMAIN. SO
CONTINUED PRE-TRAINING IS OF
COURSE AVAILABLE IN BEDROCK
TODAY. NOW ALL OF THESE
TECHNIQUES, THEY'RE ALL POWERFUL
TOOLS IN MAKING GENERATIVE AI
TARGETED, MAKING IT TRULY USEFUL
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND BEDROCK
MAKES IT REALLY EASY TO COMBINE
THESE TECHNIQUES TOGETHER. SO A
GREAT EXAMPLE OF A CUSTOMER
USING BEDROCK TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR
GENERATIVE AI AI APPLICATIONS IS
DELTA AIRLINES. SO DELTA IS
ACTUALLY MODERNIZING ITS
CUSTOMER SERVICE CAPABILITY WITH
GENERATIVE AI AI BUILT ON AMAZON
BEDROCK. THE NEW TOOL IS GOING
TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS IN A MORE RELEVANT AND
CONVERSATIONAL STYLE BY
ACCESSING DELTA'S TRAVEL
POLICIES, REAL TIME FLIGHT
SCHEDULES, CUSTOMER REBOOKING
OPTIONS AND AIRPORT CONDITIONS.
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD
RESPOND TO SIMPLE QUESTIONS LIKE
HOW MANY BAGS CAN I CHECK ON A
DELTA FLIGHT? AND IT CAN ALSO DO
MORE COMPLEX QUESTIONS LIKE CAN
I CARRY MY CAT WITH ME IN THE
CABIN TO JAMAICA? OF COURSE.
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH YOUR CAT?
DELTA'S BEEN
TESTING WITH DIFFERENT
FOUNDATION MODELS IN BEDROCK,
INCLUDING ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 2.0
CLAUDE INSTANT AND A FINE TUNED
AMAZON TITAN TEXT EXPRESS MODEL.
AND THIS WAY THEY CAN USE THE
RIGHT MODEL TO ANSWER DIFFERENT
CUSTOMER QUESTIONS IN. IT'S A
REALLY POWERFUL HOW THEY CAN
COMBINE THE MOST RELEVANT
INFORMATION NEEDED TO ANSWER ANY
SPECIFIC QUESTION. NOW, WITH THE
NEW CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOL
DELTA AIRLINES IS AIMING TO
PROVIDE A DELIGHTFUL AND
CONVERSATIONAL SELF-SERVICE
EXPERIENCE AND IT'S GOING TO
IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SO
EVERYONE WANTS MORE RELEVANT
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS,
RIGHT? AND BEDROCK IS MAKING IT
A LOT EASIER TO CUSTOMIZE THOSE
APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR OWN DATA.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU
WANT FMS TO DO MORE THAN JUST
PROVIDE USEFUL AND TARGETED
INFORMATION AND ULTIMATELY WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT IS TO USE
FMS TO TAKE ACTION TO ACTUALLY
GET THINGS DONE AND WE WANTED
YOU TO BE ABLE TO USE BEDROCK TO
COMPLETE ACTIONS LIKE BOOKING
TRAVEL, FILING INSURANCE CLAIMS,
DEPLOYING SOFTWARE, MAYBE
ORDERING REPLACEMENT PARTS. AND
THIS USUALLY REQUIRES
ORCHESTRATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE
SYSTEMS THAT OPERATE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S WHY A
FEW MONTHS AGO, WE INTRODUCED
AGENTS FOR BEDROCK. AND TODAY
I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS
POWERFUL FEATURE IS TODAY.
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. NOW WITH
AGENTS GENAI APPLICATIONS CAN
EXECUTE MULTI-STEP TASKS ACROSS
COMPANY SYSTEMS AND DATA SOURCES
FROM ANSWERING CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS ABOUT PRODUCT
AVAILABLE IOT TO TAKING A SALES
ORDER AND MORE AND BUILDING WITH
AGENTS IS REALLY EASY. FIRST,
YOU USE BEDROCK SETUP WIZARD TO
SELECT THE APPROPRIATE MODEL.
THEN YOU GIVE THE MODEL BASIC
INSTRUCTIONS TO HELP THE MODEL
UNDERSTAND HOW TO RESPOND. LIKE
YOU ARE A FRIENDLY CUSTOMER
SERVICE AGENT WHO HELPS
CUSTOMERS RETURN ITEMS. NEXT,
YOU SPECIFY THE LAMBDA FUNCTIONS
THAT EXECUTE THE API CALLS TO
RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION THAT'S
RELEVANT TO THE TASK. FOR
EXAMPLE, RETURN POLICIES OR
INVENTORY LEVELS. AND FINALLY,
YOU SELECT THE DATA SOURCES.
THEN YOU JUST SELECT, CREATE
AGENT AND BEDROCK, CONFIGURES
YOUR AGENT AND IT IS NOW READY
TO RUN WHEN THE AGENT RECEIVES A
REQUEST, IT USES ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES TO ANALYZE AND TO
PLAN THE TASK. AND THE MODEL
WORKS OUT THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS.
THE INFORMATION NEEDED, THE APIS
TO CALL AND WHEN TO CALL THEM.
THEN IT EXECUTE BETZ THE PLAN,
TAKING ALL THE STEPS THAT IT
NEEDS TO GATHER THE INFORMATION
AND THEN COMPLETE THE TASK. ALL
IN THE BACKGROUND. NO NEED TO
ENGINEER PROMPT, NO NEED TO
TRAIN THE FMS. NO NEED TO
MANUALLY CONNECT SYSTEMS WITH
AGENTS. GENERATIVE AI IS
BECOMING AN INTEGRAL PART OF
YOUR BUSINESS. MAKING IT EASY TO
TAKE ACTIONS AND GET TASKS DONE.
NO HEAVY LIFTING REQUIRED SO
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW BEDROCK
IS MAKING IT EASY TO CHOOSE
AMONGST LEADING MODELS AND ALSO
HOW IT GIVES YOU SO MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA AND HOW IT CAN
HELP COMBINE THE POWER OF MODELS
INTO YOUR ORGANIZATION'S
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA'S AND YOUR
API TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION. BUT
YOU WON'T ACTUALLY USE ANY OF
THIS IN A SERIOUS WAY IF IT
ISN'T SECURE AND PRIVATE.
I MEAN, YOU DEMAND THE
SAME ROCK SOLID RELIABILITY. THE
SAME SECURITY FOR GENERATIVE AI
THAT YOU DO FOR ANY WORKLOAD,
AND YOU REALLY NEED THIS TO HAVE
NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS
THAN EVERYTHING YOU EXPECT FROM
AN AWS SERVICE. IT'S JUST LIKE
S3. EC2. RDS. BEDROCK HAS GOT TO
HAVE ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
FEATURES TO MAKE YOUR DATA SAFE
AND PRIVATE, AND THAT'S WHAT IT
HAS. BEDROCK CUSTOMERS CAN TRUST
THAT THEIR DATA REMAINS
PROTECTED. NO CUSTOMER DATA IS
GOING TO BE USED TO TRAIN OR
IMPROVE THE ORIGINAL BASE
MODELS. WHEN YOU TUNE A MODEL,
WE MAKE A PRIVATE COPY OF THAT
MODEL. WE PUT IT IN A SECURE
CONTAINER AND IT GOES NOWHERE.
YOUR DATA IS NEVER EXPOSED TO
THE PUBLIC INTERNET, NEVER
LEAVES THE AWS NETWORK. IT'S
SECURELY TRANSFERRED THROUGH
YOUR VPC. IT'S ENCRYPTED IN
TRANSIT AND AT REST AND BEDROCK
ENFORCES THE SAME AWS ACCESS
CONTROLS YOU HAVE WITH ANY OF
OUR OTHER SERVICES AS BEDROCK
ALSO SUPPORTS A VARIETY OF
REGULATORY STANDARDS. IT'S HIPAA
ELIGIBLE. IT CAN BE USED IN
COMPLIANCE WITH GDPR. WE'VE
ADDED A BUNCH OF OTHER SECURITY
AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITIES,
INCLUDING INTEGRATIONS WITH
CLOUDWATCH TO TRACK USAGE AND
METRICS. CLOUDTRAIL TO MONITOR
API ACTIVITY AND TROUBLESHOOT
ACTIVITY. AND TODAY BEDROCK IS
SOC COMPLIANT. NOW THIS HELPS A
CUSTOMER ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS
CAN HAVE STRONG CONTROLS AND
POLICIES IN PLACE AND HELPS IT
BE USED IN EVERY BUSINESS. NOW,
BEYOND SECURITY, WE NEED
GENERATIVE AI TO BE DEPLOYED IN
A SAFE, TRUSTWORTHY AND RESPONSE
ABLE FASHION. LIKE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND
THAT'S OUR NORTH STAR FOR THE
CAPABILITIES THAT MAKE GENAI
SUCH A PROMISING TOOL FOR
INNOVATION. ALSO, DO INCREASE
THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE. WE'VE
GOT TO FIND WAYS TO UNLOCK
GENERATIVE AI AI'S FULL
POTENTIAL WHILE MITIGATING THE
RISKS. NOW, DEALING WITH THIS
CHALLENGE IS GOING TO REQUIRE
UNPRECEDENTED COLLABORATION AND
A TRULY MULTI-STAKEHOLDER EFFORT
ACROSS TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES,
POLICY MAKERS, COMMUNITY GROUPS,
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES AND
ACADEMICS. WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATING IN A LOT OF THE
GROUPS THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER
TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES EARLIER
THIS YEAR, I JOINED PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS
LIKE DARIO AS HE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'VE MADE A SERIES OF VOLUNTARY
COMMITMENTS TO PROMOTING THE
SAFE, THE SECURE AND THE
TRANSPARENT DEVELOPMENT OF AI
TECHNOLOGY. AND JUST THIS MONTH,
I JOINED A UK PRIME MINISTER
SUNAK, FOR HIS AI SAFETY SUMMIT
TO DISCUSS NEW APPROACHES,
INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF THEIR
NEW AI SAFETY INSTITUTE. NOW AN
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF
RESPONSIBLE AI IS PROMOTING THE
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOUR
CONSUMERS AND THE APPLICATIONS
THAT ARE SAFE THAT AVOID HARMFUL
OUTPUTS AND THAT STAY WITHIN
YOUR COMPANY'S GUIDELINES. AND
THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO
ACTUALLY PLACE LIMITS ON WHAT
INFORMATION THE MODELS CAN AND
CAN'T RETURN. AND WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD HERE, AND TODAY
WE'RE ANNOUNCING GUARDRAILS FOR
AMAZON BEDROCK. NOW THIS IS A
NEW CAPABILITY THAT HELPS YOU
EASILY SAFEGUARD YOUR GENERATIVE
AI APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR
RESPONSIBLE AI POLICIES TO
CREATE A GUARDRAIL. BEDROCK
PROVIDES CONFIGURATION WIZARD SO
YOU CAN ENTER A NATURAL LANGUAGE
DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPICS THAT
YOU WANT. THE MODEL TO AVOID.
GUARDRAILS CAN BE USED WITH ANY
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS
ACCESSIBLE VIA BEDROCK,
INCLUDING THE CUSTOM MODELS THAT
YOU CREATE THROUGH YOUR OWN FINE
TUNING AND YOU CAN ALSO USE
GUARDRAILS WITH AGENTS. SO NOW
YOU CAN HAVE A CONSISTENT LEVEL
OF PROTECTION ACROSS ALL OF YOUR
GENAI GENAI DEVELOPMENT
ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, A BANK
COULD CONFIGURE AN ONLINE
ASSISTANT TO REFRAIN FROM
PROVIDING INVESTMENT ADVICE OR
TO PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT
. AN E COMMERCE SITE COULD
ENSURE THAT ITS ONLINE ASSISTANT
DOESN'T USE HATE SPEECH OR
INSULTS OR A UTILITY COMPANY
COULD REMOVE PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR PII
FROM A CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL
SUMMARY. SO WE'RE APPROACHING
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF GENERATIVE
AI IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT
WAY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT
IT TAKES TO REINVENT. HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO BUILD WITH THIS
TECHNOLOGY? WE JUST, AS YOU'VE
USED AWS TO REINVENT HOW YOU'VE
BUILT AND INNOVATE IT FOR YEARS
AND ULTIMATELY TO TRANSFORM HOW
YOUR ORGANIZATION OPERATES,
WHETHER YOU'RE MIGRATING
ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS,
BUILDING THE NEXT HOT STARTUP OR
OR DEPLOYING YOUR GENERATIVE AI
STRATEGY. OUR APPROACH REMAINS
THE SAME. UM, CUSTOMER
OBSESSION, INNOVATION AND A LONG
TERM VIEW OF WHAT JOINT SUCCESS
REALLY MEANS. TO TELL US MORE
ABOUT HOW HER COMPANY IS BUILT
ON AWS AND IS NOW REINVENTING
WITH GENERATIVE AI, PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE LIDIA
FONSECA, THE CHIEF DIGITAL AND
TECHNICAL OFFICER OF PFIZER.
THANK EVERYBODY. I'D LIKE TO
START BY ASKING HOW MANY
PATIENTS DO YOU THINK PFIZER
TREATED LAST YEAR? YOU MAY BE
THINKING IN THE MILLIONS, BUT IN
FACT WE TREATED 1.3 BILLION
PATIENTS WITH OUR MEDICINES AND
VACCINES. THAT'S ONE OUT OF SIX
HUMANS ON THE PLANET. A TRULY
HUMBLING, ACCOMPLISHED AGENT.
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE
RECOGNIZED AS AN INNOVATIVE AND
ETHICAL COMPANY LISTED IN
FORTUNE'S WORLD'S MOST ADMIRED
COMPANIES. FORBES WORLD'S BEST
EMPLOYERS, AND TIME MAGAZINE'S
WORLD'S BEST COMPANIES, PFIZER
IS EXPERIENCING AN EXCITING
PERIOD OF INNOVATION AND GROWTH
WITH THE LAUNCH OF 90 MEDICINES
AND VACCINES IN 18 MONTHS. THIS
HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BY US OR ANY
OTHER PHARMA COMPANY. IT IS AN
INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS GOAL AND WE
ARE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 13
ALREADY LAUNCHED DIGITAL DATA
AND AI ARE CRITICAL TO OUR
SUCCESS. AS AND WHAT
DIFFERENTIATES PFIZER IS THAT WE
APPLY THIS ACROSS ALL BUSINESS
UNITS. OUR 36 PLANTS AND THE 149
MARKETS THAT WE SERVE QUICKLY
AND AT SCALE TO BRING MEDICINES
TO PATIENTS FASTER. OUR SUCCESS
TODAY RESTS ON THE GROUNDWORK WE
LAID FOR TECHNOLOGY AND AI TO
FLOURISH. CENTRAL IZING OUR
DATA, CREATE STANDARD PLATFORMS,
CULTIVATING STRONG TALENT AND
BUILDING A SECURE FOUNDATION IN
ALL TO INNOVATE FOR MAXIMUM
IMPACT. WE COULD NOT HAVE
ACHIEVED THIS TREMENDOUS REACH
WITHOUT OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
WITH AWS. SO LET ME SHARE A BIT
ABOUT OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER. IN
2019 PFIZER AND AWS CREATED A
PIONEERING SCIENCE DATA CLOUD
THAT AGGREGATES MULTIMODAL DATA
FROM HUNDREDS OF LABORATORY
INSTRUMENTS, EMPOWERING OUR
SCIENTISTS TO SEARCH ALL
HISTORICAL MOLECULE AND COMPOUND
DATA IN REAL TIME COMPARED TO
WEEKS OR MONTHS IN OUR PRIOR
FRAGMENTED ENVIRONMENT AND THE
SCIENTIFIC DATA CLOUD
ACCELERATES ANALYSIS AND
COMPUTATION OF RESEARCH AND WITH
AI ALGORITHMS THAT HELP US
IDENTIFY AND DESIGN THE MOST
PROMISING NEW MOLECULES IS
BUILDING ON THAT SUCCESS IN
2021. PFIZER EMBARKED ON ONE OF
OUR BOLDEST INITIATIVE IS GOING
FROM 10% OF OUR CORE IN THE TO
CLOUD 80% MOVING IN 12,000
APPLICATIONS AND 8000 SERVERS IN
42 WEEKS. ONE OF THE FASTEST
MIGRATIONS FOR A COMPANY OUR
SIZE. THIS MOVE TO AWS SAVED US
$47 MILLION A YEAR AND HELPED US
EXIT THREE DATA CENTERS,
REDUCING 4700 TONS OF CO2
EMISSIONS OR THE EQUIVALENT
ENERGY USE BY 1000 HOMES IN A
YEAR. BUT VERY IMPORTANT ALI. IT
ENABLED US TO INNOVATE WITH
SPEED AND AT SCALE. FOR EXAMPLE,
WE REDUCED TIME TO SET UP
COMPUTING CAPACITY FROM MONTHS
TO HOURS, SPEEDING UP DATA
GENERATION FOR DRUG SUBMISSIONS
BY. 75. AND WHEN COVID HIT, AWS
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO OFFER
THEIR HELP, SCALING US INTO THE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL
CORES IN THE CLOUD AND
ACCELERATING MANUFACTURING AND
CLINICAL TRIALS. WHEN WE RAN
COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE
ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO
MANUFACTURE OUR COVID VACCINE,
AWS JUMPED IN WITH ADDITIONAL
CPUS FOR US TO MOVE FAST. AND
WHEN WE NEEDED TO SUBMIT DATA TO
THE FDA IN UNDER A DAY,
INCREASED OUR CAPACITY IN
ENABLING PFIZER TO MOVE AT THE
SPEED OF SCIENCE. IN FACT, IT
TOOK JUST 269 DAYS FROM WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED OUR PLANS TO DEVELOP A
COVID 19 VACCINE WITH BIONTECH
TO THE DAY THAT WE RECEIVED THE
FDA'S EMERGENCY USE
AUTHORIZATION ACTION. THIS
NORMALLY TAKES 8 TO 10 YEARS.
THANK YOU. WITH THE WORLD
WAITING, WE NEEDED TO
MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE THE
VACCINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
WE HELD FIRM TO OUR MANTRA
SCIENCE WILL WIN. WELL WHILE
SCIENCE DID WIN AND DIGITAL
HELPED US DO IT FASTER, PFIZER
OUR INDUSTRY LEADING DIGITAL
OPERATIONS CENTER ALLOWED US
COLLEAGUES TO SEE PRODUCTION
STATUS ACROSS PLANTS AND RESOLVE
ISSUES IN REAL TIME, YIELDING A
20% THROUGHPUT INCREASE. OUR
MRNA PREDICTION ALGORITHM
YIELDED 20,000 MORE VACCINE
DOSES PER BATCH. IMAGINE THE
LIVES IMPACT IT. TO GIVE YOU AN
IDEA OF THE SCALE, PRIOR TO
COVID, PFIZER PRODUCED 220
MILLION VACCINE DOSES IN TOTAL
AND SCALED TO 4 BILLION OF
COMMUNITY IN 2022. THIS IS NOW
AT THE HEART OF HOW OUR PLANTS
OPERATE, AND WE'RE APPLYING
THESE INNOVATIONS TO THE TO OUR
OTHER MEDICINES AND VACCINES.
MORE RECENTLY, AWS HELPED US
APPLY AI TO GENERATE ALERTS
ABOUT POTENTIAL SUPPLY CHAIN
DISRUPTIONS, PROMPTING US TO
REROUTE SHIPMENTS TO CONTINUE
DELIVERING MEDICINES TO CLINICAL
TRIAL SITES AHEAD OF HURRICANE
IAN'S LANDFALL. DIGITAL AI MADE
IT POSSIBLE FOR PFIZER TO BRING
MEDICINES TO PATIENTS AROUND THE
GLOBE FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE.
NOW LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S NEXT.
AS YOU HEARD, PFIZER HAS BEEN
HARNESSING AI TO DRIVE
INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY ON A
GLOBAL SCALE. AND MORE RECENTLY,
WE ARE LEVERAGING GENERATIVE AI,
WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO DELIVER
ANNUAL COST SAVINGS OF 750
MILLION TO $1 BILLION IN THE
NEAR TERM. SOME REAL TANGIBLE
VALUE TO USING AWS CLOUD
SERVICES. PFIZER QUICKLY
DEPLOYED FOX OUR INTERNAL
GENERATIVE AI PLATFORM ALLOWING
COLLEAGUES TO ACCESS LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS AVAILABLE IN
AMAZON BEDROCK AND SAGEMAKER AWS
BREADTH OF SERVICES AND THE
VARIETY OF LMS IN BEDROCK MEANS
WE CAN SELECT THE BEST TOOLS FOR
USE CASES IN R&D, MANUFACTURE,
MARKETING AND MORE ENABLING
PFIZER AND AWS TO PROTOTYPE 17
DIFFERENT USE CASES IN A MATTER
OF WEEKS. I IN GENERATIVE AI
WILL HELP US IDENTIFY NEW
ONCOLOGY TARGETS, A PROCESS THAT
IS LARGELY MANUAL TODAY WITH AI,
WE CAN SEARCH AND COLLATE
RELEVANT DATA AND SCIENTIFIC
CONTENT FROM MANY MORE SOURCES
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME AND
ALGORITHMS GENERATE AND VALIDATE
POTENTIAL TARGETS TO IMPROVE OUR
SCIENTIFIC SUCCESS WITH BEDROCK,
WE CAN SCAN THE MARKETPLACE FOR
COMPANIES AND ASSETS AUTOMATING
THE CREATION OF COMPANY PROFILES
TO PRIORITIZE POTENTIAL
ACQUISITION ROLES IN
MANUFACTURING. BEDROCK TAKES THE
OPTIMAL PROCESS PARAMETERS TO
IDENTIFY WHAT WE CALL THE GOLDEN
BATCH AND USES GENERATIVE AI TO
DETECT ANOMALIES AND RECOMMEND
ACTIONS TO OUR OPERATORS IN REAL
TIME. AIMING TO IMPROVE CYCLE
TIME BY 25% AWS IS AGILE CULTURE
ALIGNS WELL WITH PFIZER'S
LIGHTSAIL LEAD WAY OF WORKING.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING ON
OUR LEARNINGS TO UNDERSTAND AND
NOT JUST HOW AI CAN TRANSFORM
OUR DAILY WORK, BUT HOW IT MAY
HELP US DISRUPT THE INDUSTRY.
ORI TO CLOSE, WE'RE EXCITED TO
ACCELERATE OUR BATTLE AGAINST
CANCER. WITH PFIZER'S PROPOSED
ACQUISITION OF CDN, A BIOTECH
FOCUSED ON CANCER THERAPY. AS WE
PLAN TO BRING JENS LEADING EDGE
ANTIBODY DRUG CONJUGATE
TECHNOLOGY TO MORE PATIENTS WITH
CANCER, FASTER. YOU SEE, WE HOPE
TO ACHIEVE WITH CANCER WHAT WE
WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH COVID.
OUR WORK WITH THE AWS WILL HELP
US CONTINUE THIS GREAT MOMENTUM
FUELING OUR AMBITION TO CHANGE A
BILLION LIVES EVERY YEAR, NOT
JUST IN A PANDEMIC YEAR. THANK
YOU, AWS FOR HELPING PFIZER
BRING BREAKTHROUGHS TO PATIENTS
FASTER BECAUSE IN THE BATTLE
AGAINST DISEASE, TIME IS LIFE.
THANK YOU ALL. ONE OUT OF EVERY
SIX PEOPLE ON THE PLANET ARE
IMPACTED BY PFIZER. I MEAN, THAT
IS JUST SO IMPRESSIVE. SO
IMPRESSIVE. LYDIA MEANS SO MUCH
TO US, HONESTLY, THAT YOU'VE
TRUSTED AWS TO. TO HELP DELIVER
ALL THESE CAPABILITIES. THESE
BREAKTHROUGHS THAT ARE CHANGING
PEOPLE'S LIVES. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. AND THANK YOU, ADAM AWS
HAS JUST BEEN AN AMAZING
PARTNER. THANK YOU. WE LOOK
FORWARD TO MORE. THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. SO
ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE
ARE USING AWS FOR AGILITY FOR
SPEED AND FOR THE SCALE THAT
THEY NEED TO DRIVE THEIR
FUTURES. BUT THIS REQUIRES
EMPLOYEES WITH TOP NOTCH CLOUD
SKILLS. AND WE KNOW THAT NOT
ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE THAT CLOUD
EXPERTISE AND THAT THERE'S A
LARGE SKILL GAP THAT'S GOT TO BE
CLOSED. SO GENERATIVE AI IS OF
COURSE, THE NEXT INCREDIBLY
EXCITING NEW OPPORTUNITY. BUT
IT'S ONLY GOING TO ADD TO THAT
GAP. AND SO WE'RE INVESTING TO
HELP PROVIDE THE CLOUD SCALE
SKILLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
NEEDED ACROSS THE WORLD FOR
YEARS TO COME. AWS IS COMMITTED
TO TRAINING 29 MILLION PEOPLE
FOR FREE WITH CLOUD COMPUTING
SKILLS BY THE YEAR 2025. AND
WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 21
MILLION ALREADY TRAINED. AND WE
JUST LAUNCHED WE JUST RECENTLY
LAUNCHED THE AWS CLOUD
INSTITUTE, WHICH IS PROVIDING
DEEP CLOUD EXPERTISE TO HELP
STUDENTS LAUNCH AN ENTIRE CLOUD
CAREER. AND WE'VE ALSO LAUNCHED
100 DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING
AND AI COURSES AND RESOURCES TO
SUPPORT INNOVATION AND JUST OVER
A WEEK AGO, WE ANNOUNCED AI
READY, WHICH IS OUR NEW
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE FREE AI
SKILLS TO ANOTHER 2 MILLION
PEOPLE BY 2025 AND TO HELP
STUDENTS AROUND THE WORLD WITH
TO LEARN THE FOUNDATION SKILLS
AND TO PREPARE FOR A CAREER IN
TECH. WE ACTUALLY CREATED AN AI
AND MACHINE LEARNING SCHOLARSHIP
FUND. LET'S MEET SOME OF THE
RECIPIENT. THIS. MY NAME IS
VANIA GAREWAL. MY NAME IS JOSE
TAPIA. MY NAME IS OLYMPIA
OTIENO. WITHOUT THE AI/ML
SCHOLARSHIP, I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP MY OWN
QUESTIONS. KNOW WHAT TOOLS ARE
AVAILABLE TO SOLVE THEM. THE
NANODEGREE IS DEFINITELY
UNLOCKED. MY INTEREST IN AI
CONSTANTLY TRY TO GO OUT THERE
AND TALK TO GIRLS WHO ARE
CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN
LIFE IN KENYA DUE TO CROP
DISEASE WIZ THE RATES AT WHICH
THE YIELDS HAVE BEEN DROPPING IS
DEVASTATING. SO MY COLLEAGUES
AND I HAVE MADE A MOBILE
APPLICATION WITH AI FARMERS
PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE CROP
DISEASES. THE FACT THAT I WAS
ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM,
I NOW KNOW THAT I AM CAPABLE OF
DOING WELL IN THIS FIELD. I
MEAN, THIS IS WHY WE DO THIS
STUFF, RIGHT? WHAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE
JOSE AND OLYMPIA HERE WITH US
TODAY. SO COME ON, LET'S GIVE
THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THERE
WE GO. TO BOTH OF YOU. I'M SO
PROUD. I'M REALLY PROUD OF WHAT
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE. AND I JUST
REALLY HOPE THAT REINVENT THIS
WEEK IS JUST A GREAT, GREAT
EXPERIENCE FOR YOU. THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR LETTING US SHARE YOUR
STORIES AND FOR EVERYONE
WATCHING, WE WANT TO EMPOWER ALL
OF YOU TO BUILD AND TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF IMPACT. AND WE SEE A
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THAT BY
INFUSING GENERATIVE AI INTO ALL
OF THE SYSTEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE
USING INTO THEIR DAILY LIVES. WE
BELIEVE THAT GENERATIVE AI
SHOULD HELP EVERYONE AT WORK
SEAMLESSLY WITH HELPFUL,
RELEVANT ASSISTANCE. WHETHER OR
NOT, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST THING
ABOUT FOUNDATION MODELS IS RAG
OR ANY OF THE REST. AND THAT
BRINGS US TO THE TOP OF THE
STACK, THE APPLICATIONS THAT YOU
USE THAT ARE POWERED BY
GENERATIVE AI, LEVERAGING
FOUNDATION MODELS. WE BELIEVE
THAT GENERATIVE AI, OF COURSE,
HAS THE POTENTIAL OVER TIME TO
TRANSFORM VIRTUALLY EVERY
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THAT WE
KNOW. IT CAN POUR THROUGH THE
NOOKS AND CRANNIES OF A SYSTEM
AND ACTUALLY HELP YOU FIND DATA
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
EXISTED. AND THEN HELP YOU PUT
IT TO OPTIMAL USE. IT CAN
GENERATE INSIGHTS THAT CAN SAVE
HOURS OF MANUAL WORK AND IT CAN
TAKE PROJECTS THAT WERE SLOGS
AND MAKE THEM A SNAP. NOW, ONE
IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS HOW
GENERATIVE AI CAN MAKE THE TASK
OF WRITING CODE RADICALLY
FASTER. AND SO LAST YEAR WE
RELEASED AMAZON CODEWHISPERER,
WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD GENERATIVE
AI, WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD
APPLICATIONS, I SHOULD SAY,
FASTER AND MORE SECURELY BY
GENERATING CODE SUGGESTIONS IN
NEAR REAL TIME. NOW WITH
CODEWHISPERER DEVELOPERS USE A
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPT AND THEN
RECEIVE ACCURATE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN EVERY POPULAR IDE
. AND FOR 15 OF THE MOST POPULAR
PROGRAMING LANGUAGES, A
CODEWHISPERER GIVES DEVELOPERS A
POWERFUL BOOST FOR GENERAL CODE
EXAMPLES. AND OF COURSE WE MADE
SURE THAT IT'S GREAT FOR
PROVIDING SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS
FOR CODE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
WARNER MUSIC GROUP, THE
BUNDESLIGA AND THE CIGNA GROUP
HAVE EMBRACED CODEWHISPERER TO
ACCELERATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT
CAPABILITIES, AND TATA
CONSULTANCY SERVICES, AWS,
ACCENTURE AND HCLTECH ARE MAKING
CODEWHISPERER AVAILABLE TO TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES EACH.
NOW COHEN IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN
THE ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR
INDUSTRY. THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT CODEWHISPERER IS A GAME
CHANGER FOR THEM AND WE WANT AS
MANY DEVELOPERS AS POSSIBLE TO
REAP THE BENEFITS. AND SO WHAT
WE'VE DONE IS TO MAKE CODE
WHISPERER, TO MAKE THE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN IT FREE, FREE FOR
INDIVIDUAL USE. NOW THE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CODE
WHISPERS ARE GREAT FOR GENERAL
CODING TASKS, BUT GENERAL CODING
SUGGESTIONS CAN ONLY GET YOUR
DEVELOPERS SO FAR. IMAGINE
YOU'VE JUST HIRED A NEW
DEVELOPER FOR EVEN IF THEY ARE
WORLD CLASS, THEY ARE NOT GOING
TO DO THEIR BEST WORK UNTIL THEY
UNDERSTAND YOUR CODE BASE AND
YOUR INTERNAL BEST PRACTICES. AN
AI POWERED CODING TOOLS ARE
SIMILAR. YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT
TOOL, BUT FOR THE KIND OF SPEED
AND RELEVANCY THAT MAKES THE
MOST DIFFERENCE, YOUR SOLUTION
HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF
YOUR CODE AND THE BEST PLACE TO
FIND THAT CONTEXT IS INSIDE OF
YOUR INTERNAL APIS, YOUR
LIBRARIES AND YOUR PACKAGES.
THAT'S WHY A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AGO WE PREVIEWED A CAPABILITY
THAT ALLOWS CODEWHISPERER TO
SECURELY LEARN FROM YOUR
INTERNAL CODE BASE TO PROVIDE
MUCH, MUCH MORE PERTINENT,
CUSTOMIZED AND USEFUL CODE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS. CODEWHISPERER IS
AN EXPERT ON YOUR CODE AND CAN
PROVIDE MUCH MORE TAILORED
SUGGESTIONS. CREATING AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR INTERNAL
SDKS, YOUR APIS, YOUR LANGUAGES
AND YOUR CLASSES. AND OF COURSE
ANY CUSTOMIZATIONS ARE ISOLATE
AND WE NEVER USE CUSTOMERS
CONTENT FROM CODEWHISPERER TO
TRAIN ANY OF OUR UNDERLYING
MODELS. NOW TO UNDERSTAND THE
IMPACT OF THIS KIND OF
CUSTOMIZATION, WE WORKED WITH
PERSISTENT A DIGITAL ENGINEERING
PROVIDER. NOW
THEIR STUDIES SHOWED THAT
DEVELOPERS USING CODEWHISPERER
COMPLETED THEIR TASKS AN
ADDITIONAL 28% FASTER WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS THAN WITHOUT 28.
AND AWS IS THE ONLY MAJOR CLOUD
PROVIDER THAT'S CURRENTLY
AUTHORIZING OFFERING A
CUSTOMIZED CAPABILITY THAT
ANYONE CAN SIGN UP FOR AND USE
TODAY. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT CODEWHISPERER ABOUT
CODEWHISPERER CUSTOMIZATIONS AND
HOW IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU
ACCELERATE YOUR WORK AND
INCREASE YOUR IMPACT. BUT WE'RE
JUST GETTING STARTED AND WE SEE
A LOT MORE POTENTIAL USES WITH
GENERATIVE AI. FOR EXAMPLE,
THINK ABOUT GENERATIVE AI CHAT
APPLICATIONS. SO THESE DAYS IT
SEEMS LIKE JUST ABOUT EVERYONE
IS EXPERIMENTING WITH THEM,
RIGHT? AND WHAT THE EARLY
PROVIDERS IN THIS SPACE HAVE
DONE IS REALLY EXCITING AND IT'S
GENUINELY SUPER USEFUL FOR
CONSUMER OWNERS. BUT IN A LOT OF
WAYS, THESE APPLICATIONS DON'T
REALLY WORK AT WORK. THEY'RE
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR
CAPABILITIES ARE GREAT, BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR COMPANY. THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR DATA, YOUR
CUSTOMERS OR YOUR OPERATIONS.
AND THIS LIMITS HOW HOW USEFUL
THEIR SUGGESTIONS CAN BE. THEY
ALSO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHO
YOU ARE AT WORK. THEY DON'T KNOW
YOUR ROLE, YOUR PREFERENCES,
WHAT INFORMATION YOU USE AND
WHAT YOU DO, AND DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO. SO CRITICALLY. OTHER
PROVIDERS WHO HAVE LAUNCHED
TOOLS, THEY'VE LAUNCHED THEM
WITHOUT DATA PRIVACY AND
SECURITY CAPABILITIES. THE
VIRTUE ALI EVERY ENTERPRISE
REQUIRES. AND SO MANY CIOS
ACTUALLY BANNED THE USE OF A LOT
OF THESE MOST POPULAR CHAT
ASSISTANTS INSIDE THEIR
ORGANIZATIONS. AND THIS HAS BEEN
WELL PUBLICIZED AND JUST ASK ANY
CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY
OFFICER OR CSO AND THEY'LL TELL
YOU YOU CAN'T REALLY BOLT ON
SECURITY AFTER THE FACT. AND
EXPECT IT TO WORK AS WELL. IT'S
MUCH, MUCH BETTER TO BUILD
SECURITY INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL
DESIGN OF THE TECHNOLOGY. SO
WHEN WE SET OUT TO BUILD
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS, WE
KNEW WE HAD TO ADDRESS THESE
GAPS, HAD TO BE BUILT IN FROM
THE VERY START. RIGHT? AND
THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M REALLY
PROUD AND EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
AMAZON MQ A NEW TYPE OF
GENERATIVE AI POWERED ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO WORK FOR YOU AT WORK
. Q LETS YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS
QUICKLY WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE
INTERACTIONS, YOU CAN EASILY
CHAT, GENERATE CONTENT, TAKE
ACTIONS, AND IT'S ALL INFORMED
BY AN UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA REPOSITOR WIZ
YOUR OPERATIONS. AND OF COURSE
WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT ROCK SOLID
SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARE. SO Q
UNDERSTANDS AND RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING IDENTITIES, YOUR ROLES
AND YOUR PERMISSIONS. IF A USER
DOES NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO
ACCESS SOMETHING WITHOUT Q, THEY
CANNOT ACCESS IT WITH Q EITHER.
AND WE'VE DESIGNED Q TO MEET
ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS AND
ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS STRINGENT
REQUIREMENTS FROM DAY ONE. AND
WE NEVER WANT BUSINESS CUSTOMERS
CONTENT. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
USE THAT CONTENT FOR. Q TO TRAIN
UNDERLYING MODELS. I REALLY
BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO BE
TRANSFORMATIVE. WE WANT LOTS OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO DO
LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
TO BENEFIT FROM AMAZON. Q NOW,
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. WE WANT Q
TO HELP DEVELOPERS AND BUILDERS
BE MORE EFFICIENT, MORE
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND MORE
PROFICIENT. SO FOR STARTERS,
AMAZON Q IS YOUR EXPERT
ASSISTANT FOR BUILDING ON AWS
NOW TO SUPERCHARGE WORK FOR
DEVELOPERS AND IT PROS? WE'VE
TRAINED AMAZON Q ON 17 YEARS
WORTH OF KNOWLEDGE SO IT CAN
TRANSFORM THE WAY YOU THINK,
OPTIMIZE AND OPERATE
APPLICATIONS AND WORKLOADS ON
AWS AND WE'VE PUT AMAZON. Q
WHERE YOU WORK, SO IT'S READY TO
ASSIST YOU IN THE AWS MANAGEMENT
CONSOLE AND DOCUMENTATION CHAN
IN YOUR IDP VIA CODEWHISPERER
AND IN YOUR TEAM CHAT ROOMS LIKE
SLACK, YOU CAN CHAT WITH AWS
CLOUD TO EXPLORE AWS
CAPABILITIES, LEARN UNFAMILIAR
TECHNOLOGIES, ARCHITECT
SOLUTIONS. ITS AN EXPERT IN AWS
WELL-ARCHITECTED PATTERNS LEARNS
BEST PRACTICES AND SOLUTION
IMPLEMENTATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK AMAZON Q HOW DO I
BUILD A WEB APPLICATION WITH
AWS? WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? IT'S
GOING TO ANSWER WITH A LIST OF
POTENTIAL SERVICES THAT YOU
COULD USE, SUCH AS AMPLIFY,
LAMBDA OR EC2, AND THEN IT'S
GOING TO OFFER REASONS WHY YOU
MIGHT CONSIDER EACH SERVICE.
FROM THERE YOU CAN FURTHER
NARROW DOWN YOUR OPTIONS THROUGH
NATURAL LANGUAGE, LIKE WHICH OF
THESE WOULD BE PREFERRED? IF MY
APP IS ONLY NEEDS TO RUN FOR A
FEW SECONDS AND ONLY HAS VERY
INFREQUENT TRAFFIC LAMBDA AMAZON
Q IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR
REQUIREMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION
AND IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE YOU
WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ONCE YOU'VE
CHOSEN A SERVICE, YOU CAN ASK
AMAZON. Q HOW DO I GET STARTED?
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU STEP
BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR
CONFIGURING THE SOLUTION PLUS
LINKS TO RELEVANT INFORMATION TO
DOCUMENT STATION AND SO ON. AND
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF
HOW AMAZON Q IS GOING TO HELP
YOU WITH YOUR WORK. FOR EXAMPLE,
IF YOU ENCOUNTER AN ERROR WITH
LAMBDA IN THE CONSOLE, YOU JUST
PRESS THE TROUBLESHOOT ROUTE
WITH AMAZON Q BUTTON, AND Q IS
GOING TO RESEARCH THE ERROR, AND
IT'S GOING TO SUGGEST HOW TO FIX
IT. AMAZON. Q CAN ALSO
TROUBLESHOOT YOUR NETWORK
CONNECTIONS AND IT CAN ANALYZE
YOUR END TO END NETWORK
CONFIGURATION AND HELP RESOLVE
OF CONNECTIVITY ISSUES QUICKLY.
THAT IS A HUGE TIME SAVER. NOW
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU HELP US WITH?
HOW ABOUT CHOOSING THE OPTIMAL
EC2 INSTANCE SO YOU CAN JUST
TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR WORKLOAD AND
GET AN ACCURATE, QUICK AND
ECONOMICAL INSTANCE TYPE
RECOMMENDATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
WHICH EC2 INSTANCE TYPES PROVIDE
THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE FOR
VIDEO ENCODING AND TRANSCODING
WORKLOADS SUPPORTING GAMING USE
CASES AND YOU GET YOUR
RECOMMENDATION. IT'S THAT EASY.
THIS IS ALL VERY COOL AND WE
EXPECT THAT AMAZON Q IS GOING TO
SAVE CUSTOMERS SO MUCH TIME IN
ARCHITECTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
AND OPTIMIZING YOUR WORKLOADS.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL THE Q CAN DO
FOR YOU. AMAZON Q IS ALSO GOING
TO BE IN THE IDP FOR DEVELOPERS.
IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE
CODE IN THE IDE OR YOU NEED TO
DIG IN INTO HOW A SPECIFIC
FUNCTION WORKS, AMAZON, Q AND
CODEWHISPERER IS GOING TO HELP
YOU GET UP TO SPEED BY USING ITS
DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF AWS AND ITS
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR CODE BASES
. SO YOU NEED TO ADD TESTS. JUST
ASK Q AND IT'S GOING TO
AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE THE TEST
FOR YOU. AND THIS IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
DEVELOPERS. BUT WE KNEW WE COULD
DO EVEN MORE TO HELP YOU BUILD
EVEN FASTER. FOR EXAMPLE, THINK
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO
BUILDING A NEW FEATURE. YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENTS.
THINK THROUGH DESIGN, WRITE ALL
THE CODE, ADD TESTS, DOCUMENT
THE CODE AND SO ON, AND A FILE
COULD SPAN HUNDREDS TO EVEN
THOUSANDS OF LINES OF CODE. AND
THIS IS A DAUNTING TASK. IF
YOU'RE USING AMAZON
CODEWHISPERER IT'S GOING TO
GENERATE CHUNKS OF NEW CODE FOR
YOU, WHICH IS A REAL TIME SAVER
THAT STILL LEAVES ALL THE REST.
SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR
AMAZON. Q SPECIFICALLY, Q'S
FEATURE DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY,
WHICH IS GOING TO AUTOMATE THE
MULTI STEP DEVELOPMENT TASK OF
ADDING NEW FEATURES TO YOUR
APPLICATION. SO INSTEAD OF ALL
THAT WORK NOW YOU JUST WRITE A
PROMPT AND Q IS GOING TO USE ITS
EXPERTISE ENRICHED WITH AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR PROJECT
CODE, AND IT'S GOING TO DO ALL
THE HEAVY LIFTING FOR YOU. SO
AMAZON Q WILL CREATE THE DRAFT
PLAN, WHICH YOU CAN THEN
COLLABORATE AND ITERATIVELY
IMPROVE USING NATURAL LANGUAGE
CHAT UNTIL IT'S POLISHED AND
READY TO GO. AND THEN Q REALLY
KICKS INTO GEAR. IT'S GOING TO
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN ACROSS YOUR
FILES IN YOUR APPLICATION. AN
AND YOU REMAIN IN CONTROL USING
YOUR EXPERTISE TO REVIEW CHANGES
AND ENSURE THE VERY BEST
QUALITY. SO THIS IS HOURS OF
WORK THAT Q CAN DO FOR YOU WITH
JUST ONE GOOD PROMPT. AND THIS
FEATURE IS AVAILABLE TODAY IN
AMAZON CODE CATALYST AND WILL
SOON BE FULLY AVAILABLE IN THE
IDE. YOU WILL NOT CURRENTLY FIND
AN AI ASSISTANT FROM ANOTHER
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER THAT CAN DO
THIS FOR YOU TODAY. BUT WE'RE
NOT DONE YET. LET'S KEEP GOING.
WE KNOW THAT DEVELOPERS SPEND A
LOT OF TIME SLOGGING THROUGH THE
MUCK THAT COMES WITH MAINTENANCE
AND UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE AND
UPGRADES. BIG DEAL, RIGHT? SO
TAKE TAKE LANGUAGE VERSION
UPGRADES, FOR EXAMPLE. HOW MANY
OF YOU ARE USING OLDER VERSIONS
OF JAVA? BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO
TAKE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS TO
UPGRADE HANDS? OH YEAH. A LOT OF
THEM. SO MIGRATIONS ARE
INEVITABLY COME WITH A LOT OF
NUANCE AND EDGE CASES. AND SO
YOU END UP SPENDING A TON OF
TIME WRITING AND REWRITING THE
CODE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND
TRYING TO GET IT COMPILE TO
COMPILE AND WORK. AND SOMETIMES
THESE PROGRAMS TAKE SO LONG THAT
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE IN A
MIGRATION INFINITY LOOP. JUST AS
ONE ENDS, THE NEXT BEGINS. AND
IT'S NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE
TEMPTATION TO JUST MAINTAIN
STATUS QUO. BUT DOING THAT MEANS
THAT YOU MISS OUT ON PERFORMANCE
IMPROVEMENTS AND IT MEANS MUCH
WORSE THAT IT CAN ALSO OPEN YOU
UP TO POTENTIAL SECURITY
VULNERABILITIES. AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT INTO AMAZON. Q CODE
TRANSFORMATION, WHICH HELPS YOU
WITH UPGRADES TO TRANSFORM CODE
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME THAT
IT TAKES TODAY. ALL THE
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO ALL A
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO IS ASK YOU
TO PERFORM THE CODE
TRANSFORMATION AND IT HANDLES
THE REST FROM IDENTIFYING AND
UPGRADING AND MANDATORY CODE
PACKAGE DEPOSITORIES AND
FRAMEWORKS TO REPLACING
DEPRECATED CODE AND
INCORPORATING SECURITY BEST
PRACTICES. CUZ EVEN GOING TO RUN
TESTS ON THE UPGRADED
APPLICATION VERSION. SO WE'VE
BEEN USING THIS, THIS
APPLICATION, THIS THIS
CAPABILITY INTERNALLY AND THE
RESULTS ARE STUNNING. SO WITH
AMAZON Q TRANSFORMATION IN A
VERY SMALL TEAM OF AMAZON
DEVELOPERS SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADED
1000 APPLICATIONS FROM JAVA
EIGHT TO JAVA 17 IN JUST TWO
DAYS. NOW I'M GOING TO SAY THAT
AGAIN, 1000 APPLICATION UPGRADES
IN TWO DAYS. THAT'S HOW LONG A
SINGLE APPLICATION UPGRADE USED
TO TAKE. I MEAN, THIS IS MONTHS,
MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS OF
DEVELOPER TIME SAVED A LOT OF
VERY HAPPY PEOPLE AT AMAZON OVER
THIS. I PROMISE YOU. SO TODAY,
AMAZON. Q CAN WORK ITS MAGIC ON
JAVA UPGRADES, BUT SOON YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT TO
HELP MIGRATE YOUR NETWORK LOADS
FROM WINDOWS TO LINUX. AND THERE
ARE A LOT OF APPLICATIONS OUT
THERE STUCK ON WINDOWS BECAUSE
OF THE SHEER EFFORT REQUIRED IN
MAKING THE MIGRATION. AND THIS
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HUGE COST
SAVINGS ON COSTLY LICENSING FEES
ON TOP OF THE INHERENT
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY
BENEFITS. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE
OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION? ALL THE FOLKS IN
MARKETING, FINANCE, HR, PRODUCT
MANAGEMENT AND MORE? THERE'S SO
MUCH INFORMATION SPREAD ACROSS
YOUR ORGANIZATION'S DOCUMENTS,
VASS ALL OF YOUR DATA, ALL OF
YOUR APPLICATIONS, ASIANS AND
PEOPLE IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
ROLES, THEY STRUGGLE EVERY DAY
TO FIND THE INFORMATION THAT
THEY NEED TO AND THEN TRANSFORM
IT INTO MAKING DECISIONS AND
TAKING ACTIONS AND DOING THAT
FAST ENOUGH TO STAY COMPETITIVE,
OF FINDING RELEVANT INFORMATION,
MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS, TAKING
ACTION THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR,
RIGHT? YEP AMAZON. Q IS ALSO
YOUR BUSINESS EXPERT. Q HAS
CONNECTIONS TO OVER 40 POPULAR
ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS, SO EMPLOYEES
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION CAN ASK
COMPLEX QUESTIONS AND GET
DETAILED, ACCURATE, NUANCED
ANSWERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO
THEIR ROLE AT WORK. AND AGAIN,
SECURE IS SECURE AND Q IS SECURE
AND PRIVATE. IT RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING ROLES AND THE
PERMISSIONS THAT ARE GRANTED
UNIQUELY TO EACH USER. WE'RE
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, AND I
ACTUALLY WANTED TO SHOW YOU JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF AMAZON. Q AND
FOR YOUR BUSINESS IN ACTION. SO
TO PUT THROUGH Q PUT Q THROUGH
ITS PACES. PLEASE WELCOME AWS
OWN DR. MATT WOOD TO THE STAGE.
THANKS, ADAM, AND GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE. I'M EXCITED TO GIVE
YOU A FIRST LOOK AT AMAZON. Q A
NEW TYPE OF AI ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO BE AN EXPERT IN YOUR
BUSINESS WITH AMAZON. Q YOU CAN
GET QUICK, ACCURATE, RELEVANT
ANSWERS TO YOUR MOST PRESSING
BUSINESS QUESTIONS, ALL
DELIVERED SECURELY AND
PRIVATELY. GETTING STARTED WITH
Q IS SIMPLE AND TAKES JUST THREE
STEPS. FIRST, YOU CONFIGURE
AMAZON Q BY CONNECTING AND
CUSTOMIZING Q WITH DETAILS OF
YOUR OWN ORGANIZATION. THEN Q
CONNECTS TO EXISTING DATA
SOURCES LIKE S3 SALESFORCE,
MICROSOFT, GOOGLE SLACK AND MORE
SUPPORTING OVER 40 POPULAR
BUSINESS APPLICATIONS AND
SERVICES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.
ONCE CONNECTED AMAZON Q STARTS
INDEXING ALL OF YOUR DATA AND
CONTENT, LEARNING EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR
BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES
UNDERSTANDING THE CORE CONCEPT
PRODUCT NAMES, ORGANIZATION,
STRUCTURE, ALL THE DETAILS THAT
MAKE YOUR BUSINESS UNIQUE, AS
WELL AS INDEXING THE DATA FROM
THESE SOURCES. Q ALSO USES
GENERATIVE AI TO UNDERSTAND AND
CAPTURE THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION
WHICH MAKES YOUR BUSINESS
UNIQUE. THIS ADDITIONAL SEMANTIC
INFORMATION IS CAPTURED AS
VECTOR EMBEDDINGS, ALLOWING Q TO
PROVIDE HIGHLY RELEVANT RESULTS
WHICH ARE TAILORED TO YOUR
SPECIFIC COMPANY AND INDUSTRY.
YOUR DATA REMAINS COMPLETELY
UNDER YOUR CONTROL AT ALL TIMES.
AMAZON Q NEVER SHARES IT
EXTERNALLY OR USES IT TO IMPROVE
ANY OF THE UNDERLYING MODELS,
AND THAT'S IT. SURPRISE. THERE
IS NO STEP THREE. JUST OPEN
AMAZON Q IN YOUR BROWSER AND
AWAY YOU GO WITH A FULLY
CUSTOMIZED, SECURE ASSISTANT WHO
IS AN EXPERT IN YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU COMMUNICATE WITH Q THROUGH
THIS FRIENDLY WEB APPLICATION
DESIGNED FOR EVERYONE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION TO USE. Q KNOWS WHO
YOU ARE AND ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY
AND ROLE. AND BECAUSE Q
UNDERSTANDS YOUR BUSINESS
SEMANTICS, YOU CAN ASK FAR MORE
DETAILED AND NUANCED QUESTIONS
AND GET TAILORED ANSWERS FASTER
THAN EVER BEFORE FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK Q TO ANALYZE WHICH
PRODUCT FEATURES CUSTOMERS ARE
STRUGGLING WITH AND RECOMMEND
WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM AS SOON AS
YOU HIT ENTER. Q GETS TO WORK ON
UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION AND
PREPARING AN ANSWER. Q STARTS BY
CREATING A SET OF INPUT PROMPTS.
AUTOMATIC ALI. Q THEN USES ALL
OF THE BUSINESS CONTEXT
AVAILABLE TO FIND RELEVANT DATA,
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS AND
PICKS THE BEST ONES BEFORE
COMBINING EVERYTHING TOGETHER
INTO A RESPONSE, ALL IN JUST A
FRACTION OF A SECOND, USING THE
POWER OF GENERATIVE AI AMAZON Q
REMAINS FAITHFUL TO YOUR
ORIGINAL SOURCES, CITING THEM IN
LINE SO THAT YOU CAN VALIDATE
THE INFORMATION EASILY. Q'S
EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE MAGICAL, BUT
THERE IS NO MAGICAL BLACK BOX
JUST GIVING YOU ANSWERS. YOU CAN
UPLOAD NEW WORD DOCUMENTS TO
CSVS AND OTHER FILES ON THE FLY.
GO TO Q TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS
RESPONSES, LETTING YOU ASK
QUESTIONS ABOUT AD HOC DATA
WHICH HASN'T YET BEEN ADDED TO
ANY CORPORATE SYSTEM. AND AMAZON
Q WAS BUILT WITH PRIVACY AND
SECURITY IN MIND FROM THE GROUND
UP. SO EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SEEK
INFORMATION TO WHICH WE DON'T
HAVE ACCESS, AMAZON Q RESPECTS
YOUR EXISTING ACCESS CONTROLS
ONLY RETURNING INFORMATION
YOU'RE AUTHORIZED TO SEE. ADMINS
CAN ALSO RESTRICT SENSITIVE
TOPICS FILTERING OUT
INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS AND
ANSWERS WHERE NECESSARY. FINALLY
AMAZON Q CAN TAKE ACTIONS ON
YOUR BEHALF THROUGH A SET OF
CONFIGURABLE PLUGINS? AS AN
EXAMPLE, IF YOU UPDATE, SAY,
YOUR TRAINING PRIORITIES, Q CAN
AUTOMATICALLY CREATE TICKETS IN
JIRA. NOTIFY LEADERS IN SLACK
AND UPDATE DASHBOARDS IN
SERVICENOW. Q ALLOWS YOU TO
INSPECT ACTIONS BEFORE THEY RUN
SO YOU CAN REVIEW THEM AND ADD
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND
AFTER THE ACTION RUNS, Q WILL
LINK TO THE RESULTS FOR
VERIFICATION. SO IN SUMMARY,
AMAZON Q BRINGS AI ASSISTANT
INTO THE BUSINESS WORLD,
PROVIDING SECURE TO RELEVANT AND
ACTIONABLE GUIDANCE TAILORED
ENTIRELY TO YOUR COMPANY. WE
CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO TRY. Q AND
SEE HOW IT WILL HELP YOUR
ORGANIZATION WITH THAT. BACK TO
ADAM. THANKS A LOT. THAT WAS
AWESOME. AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
BUSINESSES. EMPLOYEES ARE GOING
TO LOVE AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS AND DISCOVER
AND SYNTHESIZE NEW INFORMATION
AND LIFT FOLKS OUT OF MONOTONOUS
DRAG OF REPETITIVE TASKS. AND IT
IS GOING TO LOVE HOW ALL OF THIS
COMES WITH RIGOROUS SECURITY AND
PRIVACY. NOW, I KNOW AT LEAST A
FEW OF YOU OUT THERE ARE
WONDERING IF AMAZON Q CAN ACCESS
MY DATA? DOES THAT MEAN IT CAN
HELP WITH MY BUSINESS
INTELLIGENCE? YES. AND OF COURSE
THE ANDREW NG ANSWER IS A
RESOUNDING YES. SO WE'VE BEEN
WORKING FOR A WHILE TO MAKE
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE MORE
ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WITHOUT BI
EXPERTISE. WE THINK ANYONE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS
OF THEIR DATA USING NATURAL
LANGUAGE AND SO AMAZON
QUICKSIGHT OUR ML POWER BI
SERVICE NOW HAS AMAZON Q
FEATURES BUILT IN FIRST AMAZON Q
IS GOING TO HELP REDUCE THE TIME
THAT IT TAKES BUSINESS ANALYSTS
TO CREATE DASHBOARDS AND REPORTS
FROM HOURS DOWN TO MINUTES BY
LETTING THEM SIMPLY TELL AMAZON
Q WHAT THEY WANT TO VISUALIZE.
FOR EXAMPLE, REGIONAL SALES BY
PRODUCT IS A SANKEY DIAGRAM. Q
COMES RIGHT BACK WITH THAT
DIAGRAM. UM, AND YOU CAN ADD IT
TO YOUR DASHBOARD WITH EASE AND
YOU CAN TELL. Q TO FURTHER
REFINE THE VISUAL, SAY YOU WANT
TO CHANGE THE CHART TO A
VERTICAL STACKED BAR CHART BY
MONTH AND COLOR CODED BY REGION.
YOUR WISH IS Q'S COMMAND. WITH
Q, YOU CAN GET BETTER DASHBOARDS
FASTER, BUT EVEN THE BEST
DASHBOARDS DON'T TELL EVERY
ANGLE OF THE STORY. FOR, FOR
EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ASK AMAZON. Q
WHERE DID WE HAVE THE HIGHEST
SALES? AND YOU GET A GET A
RESPONSE CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR
BUSINESS DATA. YOU CAN ASK A
FOLLOW UP QUESTION EVEN AS
LITTLE AS ONE WORD LIKE LONDON.
AND BECAUSE Q MAINTAINS THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR CURRENT
CONVERSATIONS, YOU CAN GET
INSIGHTS FROM YOUR DATA QUICKLY.
ORI NOW ENABLING PEOPLE TO TALK
TO Q AND QUICKSIGHT IS A BIG
STEP FORWARD IN HELPING YOUR
ORGANIZATION BE EVEN MORE DATA
DRIVEN. BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
GETTING HANDS ON WITH DATA. A
LOT OF PEOPLE CONSUME DATA
THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AND
REPORTS, AND SO, SO MUCH OF YOU
DO AT WORK IS TELLING STORIES
WITH DATA. AND AS YOUR BUSINESS
EXPERT, Q IS HERE TO MAKE THAT
EASIER TOO. LET'S SAY YOU WANT
TO CREATE A MONTHLY REPORT ON
YOUR BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA.
YOU CAN ASK YOU TO WRITE A
MONTHLY REPORT ABOUT THE
BUSINESS AND MAKE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT MONTH.
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU
VISUALIZATION OPTIONS. YOU
CHOOSE THE ONES YOU WANT, AND
THEN Q WILL FORMAT THEM. AND IN
SECONDS YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL AND
COMPELLING STORY AND IT'S
COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE. YOU CAN
ACTUALLY ADD MORE CONTEXT TO THE
SECTION BY ASKING YOU TO ADD A
VISUAL OF THE USAGE TREND, AND Q
WILL GENERATE A SHORT SUMMARY.
AND THEN YOU CAN FURTHER TWEAK
IT BY MAKING IT LONGER, SHORTER
OR REFORMATTING IT TO BULLETS.
LET'S MAKE IT LONGER. ONCE WE'RE
HAPPY WITH THE STORY, WE CAN
SECURELY SHARE IT WITH OTHERS.
WITH AMAZON Q AND QUICKSIGHT YOU
NOW HAVE AN EXPERT BI ASSISTANT
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR BUSINESS ANALYSTS AND IT'S
GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR END
USERS TO GET ANSWERS TO AND
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND THESE NEW Q
CAPABILITIES AND QUICKSIGHT ARE
AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW TODAY. NOW,
A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE
TARGETED TO HORIZONTAL USE CASES
OR SPECIFIC LINES OF BUSINESS
AND AWS HAS APPLICATIONS IN
THESE AREAS TOO. SO OUR FIRST
SPECIALIZED LINE OF BUSINESS
SOLUTION WAS AMAZON CONNECT. SO
IT'S BORN IN THE CLOUD AND OF
COURSE, AMAZON CONNECT IS A
SCALABLE COST EFFECTIVE, EASY TO
USE. CONTACT CENTER APPLICATION
THAT'S REINVENTED CUSTOMER
SERVICE GENERATIVE AI THAT KNOWS
YOUR BUSINESS IS GOING TO HAVE
AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON THE
WHOLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
EXPERIENCE ACROSS SO MANY
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. YOUR
CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAMS ARE AT
THE HEART OF YOUR BUSINESSES
DELIVERING INTERACTIONS THAT
PEOPLE REMEMBER FOR GOOD AND FOR
BAD. SO GETTING THIS RIGHT
REALLY MATTERS IS TODAY CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS SPEND A LOT OF
TIME GATHERING INFORMATION FROM
CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR
QUESTIONS AND THEN THEY SPEND
EVEN MORE TIME SEARCHING FOR THE
RIGHT ANSWER. NOW CONNECT HAS
MADE THIS A LOT EASIER ALREADY
WITH MACHINE LEARNING
TRANSCRIPTION ANALYTICS, BUT WE
KNEW WE COULD MAKE IT EVEN
BETTER FOR YOUR AGENTS AND
CERTAINLY FOR THE CUSTOMERS
WAITING ON THE OTHER END OF THE
LINE FOR HELP. ENTER AMAZON Q
AND CONNECT AVAILABLE TODAY AND
THIS IS GOING TO GIVE CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS A MAJOR ASSIST
AGENTS CAN CHAT WITH. Q DIRECTLY
INSIDE OF AMAZON CONNECT TO HELP
THEM RESPOND QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS. LIVE CHAT WITH Q WITH
FAST ANSWERS IS GREAT, BUT WHAT
IF YOU COULD MAKE THE CALL
ITSELF THE PROMPT NOW INSIDE OF
CONNECT? Q IS ACTUALLY THERE ON
THE CALLS ASSISTING WITH
PROPOSED RESPONSES WITH
SUGGESTED ACTIONS, WITH LINKS TO
RELEVANT ARTICLES? NO TYPING
REQUIRED, SO CONTACT CENTERS,
SUPERVISORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
ARE ALSO GOING TO GET A
GENERATIVE AI BOOST CONNECT NOW
AUTOMATICALLY CREATES POST CALL
SUMMARIES THAT SUPERVISORS CAN
USE TO TRACK FOLLOW UP ACTIONS
AND TO UNCOVER AGENT COACHING
OPPORTUNITIES. AND FOR
ADMINISTRATORS, CONNECT CAN SET
UP CHAT BOTS AND INTERACTIVE
VOICE RESPONSES THROUGH SIMPLE
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPTS.
STREAMLINE LEARNING THE PROCESS.

IT'S SO EARLY IN THE GAME AND
WE'RE INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
DO TOGETHER. NOW, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING THAT CUSTOMERS ARE
GOING TO NEED FOR ANY OF THIS TO
WORK, AND THAT'S DATA. YOUR
DATA. NO ONE ELSE HAS IT. NO ONE
ELSE CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU CAN
. YOUR DATA IS KEY TO SETTING
YOUR ORGANIZATION APART FROM THE
PACK. AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED,
GENERATIVE AI HAS JUST MADE IT
SO MUCH MORE RELEVANT AND
IMPACTFUL WHEN YOU TAILOR YOUR
DATA. SO LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM A
LONG TIME CUSTOMER ABOUT HOW
THEY'RE USING DATA TO CREATE
FIRST CLASS EXPERIENCES FOR
THEIR CUSTOMERS. SO PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE, STEPHANE
DURACH, VP OF CONNECTED COMPANY
AT BMW.
THANK YOU. HELLO EVERYONE. IT'S
FANTASTIC TO BE HERE. I COULDN'T
AGREE MORE DATA IS KEY. THE
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCT COMPLEXITY IS
STRONGLY INCREASED. KING AND
DEVELOPMENT SPEED IS ESSENTIAL.
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW BMW IS
MASTERING DATA ACCELERATING THE
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND
DELIVERING BEST IN CLASS
EXPERIENCE TO OUR CUSTOMER
ANYWHERE. AND ANYTIME ACROSS THE
ENTIRE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO FROM
BMW TO MINI AND EVEN ROLLS-ROYCE
, BMW IS PROVIDING GAME CHANGING
VEHICLE ENTERTAINMENT AND
EXPERIENCE POWERED BY AWS. WE
OPTIMIZE OUR TECH STACK, IMPROVE
OUR WORKFLOW AND USE DATA BY
LEVERAGING AWS CLOUD TECHNOLOGY.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES.
CLOUD DATA, BMW CENTRAL DATA
LAKE BUILT BY BMW AND AWS HOSTED
DATA FROM OUR CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET AND BY UPLOADING UPHOLDING
THE STRICTEST DATA PRIVACY
STANDARDS ON TOP OF IT, TEAMS
CAN BUILD THEIR APPLICATION AND
MODEL AS WELL AS DEPLOY UPDATES
AND IMPROVEMENTS TOGETHER. WE
ARE EXPLORING INNOVATIVE USE OF
MACHINE LEARNING, INCLUDING
AMAZON SAGEMAKER. THIS AUTOMATED
DRIVING PLATFORM IS BY BMW IS
BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF
DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEM ON
AWS. THIS AUTOMATED DRIVING
PLATFORM IS CAPABLE TO HANDLE
SEVERAL HUNDRED PETABYTE OF DATA
FROM OUR GLOBAL TEST FLEET. WE
ARE ACCELERATE TESTING OUR
DEVELOPMENT, SIMULATING AND
VALIDATION PROCESS DRAMATICALLY
FOR OUR PRODUCT LAUNCH IN 2025
WITH OUR ROUTE OPTIMIZED
CHARGING SERVICES, WE ARE
PROVIDING REAL TIME TRAFFIC
CALCULATION BASED ON DRIVING
STYLE PREFERENCE TRAFFIC OR
AVAILABLE CHARGING STATIONS AND
MANY MORE. WE ALSO USE AMAZON
TECHNOLOGY LIKE ALEXA FOR OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
AND FIRE TV TO CREATE UNIQUE
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, INSIGHT,
THE VEHICLE, OUR CONNECTED
VEHICLE AI PLATFORM IS BUILT ON
AWS AND FORMED THE BACKBONE OF
THE LARGEST CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET WHERE DE FOR SOME MORE
EVEN EYE OPENING STATS, LET'S
DIVE IN. 20 YEARS AGO BMW
INTRODUCED ITS FIRST VEHICLE
CONNECTED VEHICLE AND WE COME
QUITE A LONG WAY SINCE THEN. AND
NOW THE BMW GROUP HAS THE
LARGEST CONNECTED FLEET WITH
MORE THAN 20 MILLION VEHICLES
GLOBALLY OVER THE LAST THREE
YEARS. WE MIGRATED THE CONNECTED
VEHICLE BACKEND TO AWS BY
UTILIZING THE GLOBAL PRESENCE OF
AWS IN MANY REGIONS WORLDWIDE.
WE ARE UPDATE ADDING MORE THAN 6
MILLION VEHICLES OVER THE AIR ON
A REGULAR BASIS. THE THOSE
NUMBERS ARE GROWING CONSTANTLY.
IT REQUIRES TO MANAGE MORE THAN
12 BILLION REQUESTS PER DAY WITH
OVER 1000 DIFFERENT
MICROSERVICES. ULTIMATELY, WE
ARE PROCESSING MORE THAN 110TB
OF DATA TRAFFIC PER DAY WITH A
REMARKABLE RELIABILITY. LOOK AT
THESE NUMBERS. I'M ALWAYS
IMPRESSED, HOWEVER, WITH OUR NEW
PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE. THIS
NUMBER WILL TRIPLE IN THE NEXT
TWO YEARS. LET'S CHANGE
PERSPECTIVE AND TAKE A LOOK AT A
COUPLE OF NUMBERS IN THE
DEVELOPMENT PHASE. MORE THAN
8500 SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
WORLDWIDE CREATE FIRST CLASS
CODE FOR OUR VEHICLE AND
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE BMW SERIES
RUN SEVEN SERIES RUNS ON OVER
500 MILLION LINES OF CODE. OUR
WORLDWIDE DEV OPS TEAMS EXECUTE
MORE THAN 110 SOFTWARE, BUILDS
EVERY DAY BY USING MORE THAN
60,000 VIRTUAL CPUS TO KEEP UP
WITH OUR DEMAND. WE USE AWS
SERVICES TO SCALE UP AND
ACCELERATE DEVELOPMENT WHENEVER
IT IS NECESSARY. LET'S TAKE A
DEEPER LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT.
TRADITIONALLY, BMW'S COMES FROM
A HARDWARE DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
AND EVERY DEVELOPER HAD TO DO
THE DEVELOPMENT WORK ON A
PHYSICAL TEST TRACK. TODAY WE
ARE USING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY
TO STREAMLINE OUR INFOTAINMENT
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE NEW
APPROACH ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE
TEST FUNCTIONALITIES REMOTELY TO
OUR GLOBAL DEVELOPER TEAMS. AN
EXAMPLE IS USING AMAZON EC2 FOR
VIRTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE
CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COLLABORATION.
OUR NEXT STEP IS TO EXTEND THIS
APPROACH TO BUILD A FULLY
VIRTUAL DIGITAL TWIN. NOW LET'S
TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND SOME
EXCITING FEATURES WE CREATED FOR
OUR MINI CUSTOMERS. ON THE
PICTURE, YOU CAN SEE THE MINI
INTERIOR. IT'S OUR WAY TO
EMPHASIZE BRAND TYPICAL DESIGN.
TAKE THE IMPRESSIVE ROUND ALI
DISPLAY IN OUR NEW MINI FAMILY.
AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, OUR SPEECH
IS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE DOMINANT
MODALITY FOR INTERACTING WITH
VEHICLES. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY
INTEGRATING ALEXA VOICE
ASSISTANT. HOWEVER, THIS YEAR WE
ARE RAISING THE BAR. WE WILL USE
ALEXA TECHNOLOGY TO BRING OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL. NOW LET'S
TAKE A SEAT IN THE BACK OF OUR
SEVEN SERIES. ONE OF OUR MOST
EXCITING FEATURE IS THE BMW
THEATER SCREEN. IT'S THE 30 INCH
SCREEN WITH AN EIGHT K
RESOLUTION. IT IS SPECTACULAR,
INTEGRATED IN THE CAR. IT GIVES
YOU A REAL CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE
WITH FIRE TV. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN
SEAMLESSLY ENJOY THEIR FAVORITE
SERIES AND MOVIES. IT'S OUR
STRONG COLLABORATION WITH AWS
AND AMAZON THAT UNLOCKS NEW
POSSIBILITIES, ENABLE US TO
THINK ABOUT THE CAR IN A NEW
DIMENSION. SO ONE LAST THING TO
GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE INTO THE
FUTURE. THIS IS THE BMW NEW
CLASS. THIS WILL LAUNCH IN 2025.
BMW HAS BEEN ALWAYS ON THE
FOREFRONT OF AUTOMOTIVE
INNOVATION. THE NEW CLASS WILL
BE A QUANTUM LEAP IN CUSTOMER
EXPERIENCE. IT WILL TAKE THE
DRIVING EXPERIENCE TO A NEW
LEVEL AS YOU CAN SEE, THE NEW
CLASS INTRODUCED A COMPLETELY
NEW INTERIOR WITH THE BMW
PANORAMIC VISION. WE DEVELOPED A
NEW HEAD UP DISPLAY TO PROJECT
INFORMATION PILLAR TO PILLAR,
AND FOR THE PERFECT DRIVER
ORIENTATION AND USER EXPERIENCE.
ALL OF THIS EMPHASIZES IMPROVE.
BMW IS MASTERING DATA
ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT
PROCESS AND DELIVERING THE BEST
IN CLASS EXPERIENCE TO THE
CUSTOMER ANYWHERE AND ANYTIME
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EXCITING AND
ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT
NOW. AWS AND THE BMW GROUP ARE
WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER TO
SHAPE THIS FUTURE. THANK YOU
ALL. GOODBYE AND I'LL SEE YOU
SOON. FOR AN INCREDIBLE DATA
PLATFORM YOU'VE BUILT AND THE
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE IT'S
CREATING FOR YOUR CONSUMERS.
JUST AMAZING. THANK YOU, STEFAN.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU, AS
ALWAYS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO
AS STEFAN HAS JUST MADE SO
CLEAR, SUCCESS WITH AI AS WELL
AS WITH NEARLY EVERY OTHER
BUSINESS PRIORITY RELIES ON
HAVING A STRONG DATA STRATEGY.
AND ONE QUESTION I HEAR FROM
CUSTOMERS FREQUENTLY IS HOW
SHOULD I THINK ABOUT DATA IN A
GENERATIVE AI WORLD? WELL, THE
ANSWER IS THAT FOR GENERATIVE
AI, YOUR DATA IS YOUR
DIFFERENTIATOR. NOW WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT CUSTOMIZATION THROUGH
BEDROCK CODEWHISPERER
CUSTOMIZATIONS, AMAZON TAILORED
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND EXAMPLES
FROM DELTA AIRLINES AND PFIZER
ALL TAL ADDING CONTEXT TO YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA IS ABSOLUTELY
CRITICAL TO PROVIDING VALUE.
NOW, IN EACH OF THESE EXAMPLES,
ALS, THE DATA USED TO CUSTOMIZE
THE APPLICATION HAS TO BE UP TO
DATE. IT HAD TO BE COMPLETE AND
ACCURATE. IT HAD TO BE
DISCOVERABLE AND IT HAD TO BE
AVAILABLE WHEN YOU NEEDED IT. SO
THE FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING ALL
OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE YOUR
DATA IS IN THE CLOUD. NOW,
GENERATIVE AI IS JUST ONE OF
MANY REASONS THAT YOU WANT THIS.
HAVING EFFECTIVE CLOUD BASED
DATA STRATEGY IS GOING TO
INCREASE YOUR INSIGHT. IT'S
GOING TO REDUCE YOUR COST AND
IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE
INNOVATION. NOW, TO UNDERSTAND
THIS, JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MANY
DIFFERENT ISSUES THERE ARE TO
CONSIDER WHEN TRYING TO MAKE THE
MOST OF YOUR DATA. ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA. IT
COMES FROM DIFFERENT ORIGINS,
AND IT COMES AT VARIOUS SCALES
AND SPEEDS AS DIFFERENT TEAMS
ALL ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION ARE
GOING TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT
DATA IN MANY, MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF WAYS. AND THEN HOW YOU
WANT TO USE THIS DATA IS JUST AS
VARIED. YOUR STORING IT, YOUR
POWERING, YOUR APPLICATIONS,
YOUR ANALYZING IT, YOU'RE
GENERATING PREDICTIONS FROM IT.
THERE'S NO ONE TOOL OR SOLUTION
THAT CAN DO IT ALL UNLESS YOU'RE
WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES LIKE
PERFORMANCE COST OR
CAPABILITIES. BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE THOSE SACRIFICE CHOICES.
SO WHAT YOU NEED IS A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF TOOLS THAT
ACCOUNTS FOR THE SCALE AND THE
VARIETY OF THIS DATA AND THE
MANY, MANY PURPOSES FOR WHICH
YOU WANT TO USE IT. YOU NEED TO
INTEGRATE IT AND COMBINE ALL
THAT DATA THAT'S SPREAD ALL OVER
TO CREATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND PREDICT
WHAT WILL HAPPEN. AND OF COURSE,
YOU NEED GOVERNANCE SO THAT YOU
CAN HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE OF
ACCESS AND CONTROL EVERY STEP OF
THE WAY. YOU NEED IT ALL. IF YOU
MISS EVEN ONE ASPECT, YOUR
ABILITY TO USE THAT DATA IS
SIGNIFICANTLY HOBBLED. SO IN
ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN
STORE, ANALYZE AND PROCESS THE
DATA YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF DATA
SERVICES SO YOU CAN GET THE
PRICE PERFORMANCE, YOU CAN GET
THE SPEED, THE FLEXIBILITY AND
THE CAPABILITIES FOR YOUR USE
CASE. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
BUILT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SET
OF CLOUD DATA SERVICES OUT THERE
. SO TO START, WE HAVE AMAZON S3
AND CUSTOMERS USE S3 TO MAKE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DATA
LAKES WHERE THEY CAN BRING
STRUCTURED DATA TOGETHER WITH
UNSTRUCTURED DATA AND MAKE IT
ALL AVAILABLE FOR ANALYTICS AND
MACHINE LEARNING. WE ALSO OFFER
EIGHT RELATIONAL DATABASES,
INCLUDING AMAZON, AURORA THE
RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICE
THAT'S BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP
FOR THE CLOUD AND IS STILL THE
FASTEST GROWING SERVICE IN AWS
HISTORY. WE ALSO HAVE EIGHT
PURPOSE BUILT DATABASES, NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES, INCLUDING
AMAZON DYNAMODB, WHICH IS USED
BY OVER A MILLION DEVELOPERS
SORRY, A MILLION CUSTOMERS FOR
ITS SERVERLESS SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND PERFORMANCE AT ANY
SCALE. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE
BROADEST AND DEEPEST SET OF
ANALYTICS SERVICES AND THIS
INCLUDES OUR DATA WAREHOUSE
SERVICE, AMAZON REDSHIFT, WHICH
DELIVERS UP TO SIX OR EVEN SEVEN
TIMES BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
DEPENDING ON YOUR WORKLOAD THAN
OTHER CLOUD DATA WAREHOUSES.
WE'VE GOT AMAZON EMR TO EASILY
RUN SPARK AND OTHER BIG DATA
WORKLOADS AND AMAZON OPENSEARCH
SERVICE WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF ACTIVE CUSTOMERS AND HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF CLUSTERS UNDER
MANAGEMENT. AND THAT ALL
PROCESSES TRILLIONS OF REQUESTS
PER MONTH AND MANY, MANY, MANY
MORE ANALYTIC SERVICES. I WON'T
GO THROUGH THEM ALL, BUT YOU
NEED THIS BREADTH AND THIS DEPTH
OF CHOICE SO THAT YOU CAN NEVER
HAVE TO COMPROMISE ON COST, ON
PERFORMANCE OR ON SCALE, AND
INSTEAD YOU CAN CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOL FOR THE JOB. NOW, WE'VE
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT AI AND ML
EXTENSIVELY, SO I'M NOT GOING TO
DWELL ON THAT HERE. BUT YOU NEED
TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOLS TO FEED YOUR AI AND
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'RE
DOING IN YOUR BUSINESS. AND THE
SECOND THING THAT YOU NEED AS
YOU MOVE TO PUT DATA AT THE
CENTER OF YOUR BUSINESS IS TO
BREAK DOWN YOUR DATA SILOS. MOST
PEOPLE HAVE DATA SPREAD OUT ALL
OVER THE ORGANIZATION IN
DATABASES, ANALYTIC TOOLS, SAAS
APPLICATIONS, SPREADSHEETS AND
MORE. AND TO GET THE MOST VALUE
FROM YOUR DATA, YOU NEED TO BE
ABLE TO USE IT ALL. NO MATTER
WHERE IT LIVES. AND TO DO THIS
TODAY, MOST PEOPLE MOVE DATA
AROUND OR TRY TO CONNECT THE
VARIOUS SILOS USING A PROCESS
CALLED ETL OR EXTRACT, TRANSFORM
AND LOAD. YEAH, I SEE SOME OF
YOU FLINCHED WHEN I SAID THAT
BECAUSE YOU KNOW. RIGHT. YOU
KNOW EXACTLY HOW BAD THIS
PROCESS CAN BE. IT IS TEARING
ALL FIRST DEVELOPERS HAVE TO
DESIGN AN ETL PIPELINE
ARCHITECTURE. THEY HAVE TO
DECIDE WHERE TO EXTRACT THE DATA
FROM, AND IT'S OFTEN COMING FROM
MULTIPLE SOURCES. THEN THEY HAVE
TO WRITE CODE TO TRANSFORM THE
DATA AND REMOVE DUPLICATES. THEY
HAVE TO FILTER OUT OUTLIERS,
RETRIEVE MISSING DATA AND
IDENTIFY CORRUPTED DATA. AFTER
ALL THAT, YOU HAVE TO TRANSFORM.
YOU HAVE TO LOAD YOUR TRANSFORM
DATA TO ITS NEW DESTINATION,
WHICH ONCE AGAIN MEANS MORE CODE
TO WRITE. THEN, IF SOMETHING
CHANGES, LIKE A DATA ENGINEER
SWAPPING OUT A DATA TABLE OR
ADDING A NEW FIELD, YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK AGAIN AND UPDATE ALL OF
YOUR CODE ONCE MORE. IT IS
MONOTONOUS, IT IS TEDIOUS AND IT
IS JUST A WHOLE LOT OF UNFUN
WORK, WHICH IS WHY WE INTRODUCED
OUR VISION OF A ZERO ETL FUTURE
FOR AND IN THIS FUTURE YOU CAN
WAVE GOODBYE TO THE BORING,
FRUSTRATING PROCESS OF ETL. YOUR
DATA IS AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTED
FROM THE SOURCE TO THE
DESTINATION. IT'S THAT EASY AND
YOU GET YOUR DATA WHERE YOU NEED
IT WHEN YOU NEED IT. NO MORE
BUILDING AND MANAGING COMPLEX,
BRITTLE PROCESSES AND PIPELINES.
IT'S REALLY EXCITING. BUT IS IT
REAL? WELL, IS IT DOWN PAYMENT?
LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED A FULLY
MANAGED ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
BETWEEN AURORA, MYSQL AND
REDSHIFT. WITHIN SECONDS OF DATA
BEING WRITTEN INTO AURORA, YOU
CAN USE REDSHIFT TO DO NEAR REAL
TIME ANALYTICS AND ON PETABYTES
OF DATA. YOU CAN ENABLE THIS
INTEGRATION WITH JUST A FEW
CLICKS AND ZERO-ETL. IT IS
INCREDIBLY EASY NOW THIS FIRST
ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IS READY,
IS READY DONE. BUT WE'VE WE'VE
WE WANT TO DELIVER SO MUCH MORE.
AND SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TODAY
TO BE ANNOUNCING THREE MORE ZERO
ETL INTEGRATIONS WITH REDSHIFT.
LET'S GET THEM ALL DONE AT ONCE.
AURORA POSTGRES RDS FOR MYSQL
AND DYNAMODB. THESE ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS AND AMAZON REDSHIFT
ARE ALL AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW
WHEN TODAY. SO. SO THAT MAKES.
YEAH. YOU DON'T LIKE THE MUCK,
DO YOU? SO THAT'S FOUR OF OUR
MOST POPULAR RELATIONAL AND NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES TOGETHER
WITH THE DATA WAREHOUSE THAT
GIVES YOU THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITHOUT ANY OF THE
ETL FANTASTIC. BUT REMEMBER,
WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THIS VISION.
SO OF COURSE OUR NEXT QUESTION
WAS, WELL, WHERE ELSE COULD WE
BE REMOVING THE PAIN OF ETL?
NOW, MANY OF YOU NEED TO USE
SEARCH ON YOUR TRANSACTIONAL
DATA TO ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE
OF YOUR APPLICATION. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE AN
E-COMMERCE APPLICATION AND YOU
WANT TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED
RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOUR USER,
YOU USE SIMILARITY SEARCH ON
TRANSACTION DATA. THAT'S GOING
TO BE STORED IN YOUR DATABASE.
SO TO DO THIS CURRENTLY YOU'RE
DESIGNING, YOU'RE BUILDING,
YOU'RE MANAGING COMPLEX DATA
PIPELINE ARCHITECTURES FROM YOUR
DATABASE TO A SEARCH ENGINE. AND
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOU ARE
BUILDING THOSE PIPELINES TO
AMAZON OPENSEARCH SERVICE FOR
ITS POWERFUL SEARCH CAPABILITIES
. I BET YOU CAN TELL WHERE WE'RE
GOING WITH THIS. SO TODAY I'M
REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE UNVEILED
ONE MORE ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IN
DYNAMO. DB ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
WITH OPENSEARCH SERVICE
GENERALLY AVAILABLE TODAY. AND
THIS NEW INTEGRATION MAKES IT SO
EASY TO SEARCH DYNAMODB DATA
WITH OUR OPENSEARCH SERVICE. AND
IT'S JUST THE FIRST OF THESE
DATABASE INTEGRATIONS TO OUR
OPENSEARCH SERVICE THAT'S GOING
TO HELP YOU DO MORE WITH DATA.
SO OUR NEW ZERO-ETL INTEGRATIONS
ARE BRINGING TRANSACTIONAL DATA
AND ANALYTICS TOGETHER FASTER
AND MORE EASILY AND CUSTOMERS
ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE
IDEA OF A ZERO-ETL FUTURE. SO
YOU CAN BE CERTAIN WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP INNOVATING HERE. NOW
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE
TOOLS THAT YOU NEED AND HOW YOU
CAN HAVE DATA WHERE YOU NEED IT
WITHOUT THE PAINFUL ETL BURDEN.
NEXT YOU WANT TO EMPOWER PEOPLE
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION TO USE
YOUR DATA TO ITS FULLEST AND YOU
WANT THEM WALLOWING IN YOUR
DATA, EXPERIMENTING, ASKING
QUESTIONS, SPARKING IDEAS. AND
YOU WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS.
BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM YOUR
DATA IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE, SO
YOU WANT TO GRANT ACCESS ONLY TO
THE RIGHT EMPLOYEES AT THE RIGHT
TIME. YOU NEED TO KEEP IT SAFE
AND SECURE. SO YOU ALSO NEED
CONTROL, YOUR ACCESS CONTROL.
KOHL THESE ARE OPPOSITES, RIGHT?
NO, YOU CAN HAVE IN FACT, YOU
MUST HAVE BOTH AND THE KEY TO
MAKING SURE THAT YOUR DATA IS,
IS SAFE, IS GOVERNED, HAS ACCESS
, IS GOVERNANCE CREATING
VISIBILITY INTO YOUR DATA AND
CONTROLLING WHO CAN ACCESS YOUR
DATA AND WHEN THEY CAN ACCESS IT
WITH ROBUST GOVERNANCE, YOU'RE
GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO
THE DATA THEY NEED AND ONLY THAT
DATA. AND WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT
DATA YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW WHERE IT
IS. YOU HAVE GUARDRAILS AND
TOOLS IN PLACE TO SAFELY UNLOCK
IT. THAT BUILDS CONFIDENCE. AND
THEN PEOPLE WITHIN THE
ORGANIZATION DEVELOP TRUST IN
THE DATA. YOU ACTUALLY EMPOWER
INNOVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION
RATHER THAN STIFLING IT. AND SO
TO HELP YOU WITH GOVERNANCE, WE
DEVELOPED AMAZON DATAZONE DATA
ZONES, A DATA MANAGEMENT SERVICE
THAT HELPS YOU CATALOG,
DISCOVER, SHARE AND GOVERN DATA
ACROSS YOUR ORGANIZATION. WE'RE
GETTING GREAT FEEDBACK FROM LOTS
OF DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
LEADER IN BRAZIL, ITAU. AND
WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE
IMPACT THAT DATA ZONE IS HAVING
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY IN THIS SPACE.
TODAY, DATA ZONE USES MACHINE
LEARNING TO AUTOMATICALLY ADD
METADATA TO YOUR CATALOG, BUT IN
ORDER TO FIND THE RIGHT DATA AT
THE RIGHT TIME, CUSTOMERS STILL
HAVE TO CHOOSE TO ADD BUSINESS
CONTEXT LIKE EXPLAINING THE
DATA'S PURPOSE OR CLARIFYING THE
COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS. AND NOW
THIS HELPS EMPLOYEES FIND THE
DATA THAT THEY NEED. IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
KNOW THE DATA EXISTS, THE
QUESTION OF ACCESS AND CONTROL
BECOMES MOOT. BUT ADDING ALL
THIS DATA IS A METADATA IS
TEDIOUS. IT'S A MANUAL PROCESS.
WELL, NO LONGER. WE'RE MAKING
YOUR CATALOGING EVEN SMARTER.
AND TODAY I'M REALLY PLEASED TO
ANNOUNCE A NEW CAPABILITY THAT
AUTOMATICALLY SUGGESTS BUSINESS
DESCRIPTIONS TO ADD CONTEXT FOR
YOUR DATA SET IN JUST A FEW
CLICKS, CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS
SIMPLY CHOOSE A DATA SET AND
DATAZONE WILL USE GENERATIVE AI
TO CREATE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS
FOR YOUR DATA. USING OUR TRAINED
MODELS. MAKING IT EASIER TO
UNDERSTAND THESE DESCRIPTIONS
CAN BE REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED, OR
EVEN FURTHER CLARIFIED OR EDITED
FOR YOUR EXACT PREFERENCES. DATA
ZONES ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO USE
YOUR DATA. THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE
TIME SAVER IN THIS CAPABILITY IS
GOING TO HELP EMPLOYEES TO FIND
THE RIGHT DATA FOR EVEN FASTER
INSIGHTS. WE'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE TO HELP YOU
USE DATA GOVERNANCE TO SET YOUR
DATA FREE. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
DO IN YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED AN
END TO END DATA STRATEGY THAT
PROVIDES CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE
ENTIRE SPAN OF YOUR DATA NEEDS.
YOU NEED TO EASILY CONNECT DATA
ACROSS SILOS AND YOU NEED YOU
NEED YOUR DATA TO BE GOVERNED TO
BE CONFIDENT THAT THE RIGHT DATA
IS USED IN THE RIGHT WAYS BY
ONLY THE RIGHT PEOPLE. WE'RE
MAKING AWS THE BEST PLACE FOR
ALL OF YOUR DATA NEEDS ACROSS
ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS.
AND WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS AND
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO MAKE DATA,
YOUR DIFFERENTIATOR IN AI AND
ACROSS YOUR BUSINESS, IT'S
AMAZING. WE'VE TALKED A LOT
ABOUT REINVENTION TODAY AND HERE
AT AWS THE MOST IMPORTANT
REINVENTION OF ALL IS YOURS TO
SUPPORT YOU IN ALL THE WAYS THAT
YOU WANT TO ADAPT AND EVOLVE. WE
CONTINUOUSLY CONTINUE TO
CHALLENGE OURSELVES. WE TRY AND
THINK DIFFERENTLY. WE TRY AND
GIVE YOU THE CAPABILITY WIZ THAT
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED, AND EVEN
SOME MAYBE THAT YOU'VE NEVER
IMAGINED. NOW, THIS ISN'T THE
WORK OF A FEW MONTHS OR EVEN A
YEAR, BUT WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT.
WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE AT
AMAZON WE MAKE BOLD BETS. SO
THIRD PARTY SELLING ON AMAZON
PRIME, EVEN AWS ITSELF IS A BIG
BET. I MEAN, IT TOOK A LOT OF
YEARS AND A LOT OF CAPITAL TO
BUILD OUT THE ON DEMAND
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES THAT
SIMPLY BECAME KNOWN AS THE CLOUD
FOR THIS LONG TERM FOCUS IS A
GOOD THING. BEING WILLING TO
THINK DIFFERENTLY AND LONG TERM
IS A GOOD THING. IT'S THE ONLY
PREDICTABLE WAY TO PROFOUNDLY
CHANGE WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR
CUSTOMERS. AWS. NOW THERE'S
ANOTHER BIG BET THAT AMAZON IS
MAKING YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF
PROJECT KUIPER AND YEAH, KUIPER.
KUIPER'S BUILDING A
CONSTELLATION OF THOUSANDS OF
LOW EARTH ORBIT SATELLITES. WHY?
WELL, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE ON EARTH LACK FAST OR
RELIABLE OR EVEN ANY INTERNET
ACCESS. PROJECT KUIPER IS GOING
TO HELP CLOSE THAT DIGITAL
DIGITAL DIVIDE BY DELIVERING
FAST, AFFORDABLE BROADBAND TO A
WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS
OPERATING IN PLACES WITHOUT
RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTIONS.
IN FACT, JUST LAST MONTH, KUIPER
, THE KUIPER TEAM SUCCESSFULLY
LAUNCHED ITS FIRST TWO PROTOSTAR
SATELLITES INTO ORBIT. IT'S JUST
INCREDIBLE THING. I MEAN, THEY
PUT SATELLITES UP THERE. THEY'RE
WORKING FLAWLESSLY. EVERYBODY'S
REALLY HAPPY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED
THERE RIGHT? WOW I MEAN, KUIPER
IS A GLOBAL HIGH SPEED SATELLITE
NETWORK THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE
COVERAGE IN PLACES THAT HAVE
NEVER HAD COVERAGE BEFORE. I
MEAN, IMAGINE THE POWER OF
DELIVERING A REALLY HARD TO
REACH PLACES, THE ABILITY TO
ACCESS THE INTERNET WITH THE
SAME SPEED. THE SAME RELIABILITY
THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED
EVERY DAY. NOW, THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR CONSUMERS IS,
FOR SURE, ENORMOUS. BUT SO ARE
THE BENEFITS TO BUSINESSES AND
GOVERNMENTS. AND THERE ARE ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES LIKE
RENEWABLE ENERGY PROVIDERS THAT
WANT TO ANALYZE IN REAL TIME
DATA FROM OFF SHORE WIND FARMS
OR FIRST RESPONDERS WHO NEED
FAST, RELIABLE CONNECTIONS
DURING NATURAL DISASTERS OR
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LOOKING
FOR CONNECTIVITY, BACKUP IN CASE
OF AN UNPLANNED OUTAGE. KUIPER
IS GOING TO HELP TO MAKE ALL OF
THIS POSSIBLE AND AWS CUSTOMERS
ARE ALREADY PLANNING FOR THE
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS OPENS UP
TO CONNECT TO THEIR FACILITIES,
THEIR SENSORS, THEIR DATA, THEIR
NETWORKS. IT'S GOING TO BE
AMAZING FOR SO MANY CUSTOMERS,
BUT SOME CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
DON'T WANT THEIR DATA RUNNING
OVER THE PUBLIC INTERNET. AND AS
YOU KNOW, SECURITY IS ALWAYS OUR
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. SO TODAY,
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THAT IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, KUIPER IS
ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE ENTERPRISE
READY PRIVATE CONNECTIVITY
SERVICES. AND NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE DATA FROM
VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE OVER PRIVATE
SECURE CONNECTIONS. AND AS YOU
USE USE THESE CONNECTIONS WITH
YOUR DATA, YOU CAN USE IT INSIDE
OF THE AWS CLOUD TO AN EARLY
ADOPTERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
START TESTING IN THE SECOND HALF
OF 2024. SO WE MAKE BIG BETS
LIKE THESE SO THAT CUSTOMERS CAN
DO THINGS THAT THEY COULDN'T
IMAGINE BEFORE. AND YOU COME ON
THIS JOURNEY WITH US BECAUSE
WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THESE
KINDS OF AUDACIOUS LEAPS AND THE
BENEFITS HAVE BEEN ENORMOUS. THE
EXCITING CHALLENGE AHEAD OF ALL
OF US THIS NEXT YEAR IS TO LOOK
CLOSELY AT OUR WORK AND TO
REIMAGINE IT, TO REINVENT IT, TO
DREAM UP EXPERIENCES THAT WERE
PREVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE AND MAKE
THEM REAL. WE ARE SO EXCITED TO
BE YOUR PARTNER IN THIS NEW
WORLD THAT WE'RE BUILDING
TOGETHER, AND I'M THRILLED THAT
WE GET TO EXPLORE IT. ALL THIS
WEEK. THIS MORNING. IT'S BEEN
INCREDIBLE. I WANT TO THANK ALL
OF MY GUESTS ON STAGE TODAY AND
THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WATCHING
AND OF COURSE, THANK YOU TO THE
WHOLE AWS TEAM FOR WORKING SO
HARD TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. NOW,
THE TEAM DOES HAVE ONE MORE
LITTLE SURPRISE UP UP THEIR
COLLECTIVE SLEEVE. SO I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE VERY
BEGINNING I MENTIONED LOUD AND
GUITARS IN IRELAND, BUT WE
ACTUALLY HAVE A LOUD GUITAR HERE
FROM OUR FRIENDS AT LOUDEN AND
WE'VE INVITED A TALENTED
GUITARIST A LONG TIME AWS
FAVORITE ZACH PERSON TO PLAY US
OUT. SO WE HAVE GOT A GREAT
CONFERENCE HERE FOR YOU THIS
WEEK. NOW LET'S GET OUT THERE
AND REINVENT. THANK YOU. NOW
TAKE IT AWAY, ZACH.
PLEASE WELCOME THE CEO OF AWS,
ADAM SELIPSKY.
GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE
12TH ANNUAL REINVENT. I AM SO
HAPPY TO BE HERE WITH MORE THAN
50,000 OF YOU HERE IN LAS VEGAS
AND MORE THAN 300,000 WATCHING
AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR
JOINING. THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU
. NOW, WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THIS
EVENT JUST A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENTLY AND REINVENT REMAINS
ABOVE ALL, A LEARNING
CONFERENCE, A LEARNING EVENT,
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN
AND GROW HERE ARE EVERYWHERE.
WE'VE GOT MORE THAN 2200
SESSIONS, AND YOU CAN CONNECT
WITH AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
PARTNERS IN THE EXPO ALL AROUND.
AND OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY,
MANY OPPORTUNITY WIZ TO CONNECT
WITH FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE AWS
COMMUNITY. SO WE'VE ALSO GOT A
GREAT SLATE OF KEYNOTES FOR YOU.
YESTERDAY, LAST NIGHT, HOPEFULLY
A LOT OF YOU SAW PETER DIVE INTO
ALL OF OUR INNOVATION AROUND
SERVERLESS. AND TOMORROW WE'VE
GOT SWAMI ON AI AND MACHINE
LEARNING AS WELL AS RUBA'S
PARTNER KEYNOTE. AND THEN OF
COURSE, WERNER CAPS OFF THE WEEK
ON THURSDAY. BUT I'M EXTREMELY
EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE IN
STORE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW HERE
TODAY. SO LET'S GET STARTED. SO
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT
REINVENT IS THE SHEER VARIETY OF
THE CUSTOMERS THAT I GET TO
MEET. I MEAN, FOLKS FROM EVERY
INDUSTRY, EVERY REGION, EVERY
USE CASE. AND THERE'S JUST
NOTHING LIKE IT ANYWHERE FOR AN
INNOVATORS ALL OVER THE WORLD
ARE RELYING ON AWS TO DRIVE
THEIR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING
LEADING ENTERPRISES FROM ACROSS
EVERY INDUSTRY, JUST TO NAME A
FEW IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE'RE
WORKING WITH JPMORGAN CHASE.
WE'RE WORKING WITH GOLDMAN
SACHS, NASDAQ, FIDELITY, ALLIANZ
ITYOU, BBVA, HSBC, GE CAPITAL
ONE, S&P GLOBAL NUBANK AND MORE.
IN HEALTH CARE, WE'RE WORKING
WITH PFIZER, GILEAD, MERCK, NOVO
NORDISK ROCHE, MODERNA, ILLUMINA
. MEDTRONIC 3M HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MORE. IN
AUTOMOTIVE, WE'RE WORKING WITH
EVERYBODY FROM BMW TO STELLANTIS
HONDA, TOYOTA, VW GROUP, NISSAN,
HYUNDAI, FORD MOTOR COMPANY,
MERCEDES BENZ, AND OF COURSE,
MORE. SO MANY AMAZING CUSTOMERS
AND PARTNERS AND STILL JUST A
SMATTERING OF THE LEADERS WE'RE
WORKING WITH TO SHAPE THE
FUTURES OF THESE INDUSTRIES. AND
ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
THAT THEY SERVE. ONE CUSTOMER
AND PARTNER. WE'VE BEEN WORKING
CLOSELY WITH FOR A NUMBER OF
YEARS IS SALESFORCE. SO IN 2016,
SALESFORCE CHOSE AWS AS THEIR
PRIMARY CLOUD PROVIDER, AND
TODAY SALESFORCE USES AWS
COMPUTE STORAGE DATA SERVICE AS
MANY OTHERS TO POWER KEY
SERVICES LIKE SALESFORCE, DATA
CLOUD AND MANY OTHERS. AND
YESTERDAY WE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
OUR PARTNERSHIP TO BRING NEW
CAPABILITIES TO OUR MUTUAL
CUSTOMERS. SALESFORCE IS GOING
TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
ITS ALREADY VERY LARGE USE OF
AWS. AWS WILL BE USING MORE
SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGIES AND
WE'RE MAKING IT EASIER FOR
DEVELOPERS TO QUICKLY BUILD AND
DEPLOY GENERATIVE AI
APPLICATIONS. JENS BY BRINGING
TOGETHER AMAZON BEDROCK WITH
SALESFORCE'S EINSTEIN PLATFORM.
WE'RE ALSO HELPING TO UNIFY DATA
MANAGEMENT WITH OUR NEW ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS BETWEEN SALESFORCE
DATA CLOUD AND AWS STORAGE AND
COMPUTE AND DATA SERVICE DATA
AND ANALYTICS SERVICES. SO THE
CUSTOMERS CAN GET EVEN BETTER
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND WE'RE ALSO
BUILDING TIGHTER INTEGRATIONS
BETWEEN SERVICE CLOUD FROM
SALESFORCE AND AMAZON CONNECT.
ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME,
SALESFORCE IS GOING TO BE
PUTTING ITS PRODUCTS ON THE
MARKET PLACE, MAKING IT EVEN
EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO FIND, TO
BUY AND TO MANAGE SALESFORCE
OFFERINGS. SO WITH THIS EXPANDED
PARTNERSHIP AND SALESFORCE
CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO GET NEW,
POWERFUL WAYS TO INNOVATE AND
BUILD APPLICATIONS. BUT IT'S NOT
JUST GLOBAL ENTERPRISE IS THE
MOST PROMISING UP AND COMER ALSO
CONTINUE TO CHOOSE AWS AS WELL.
ACCORDING TO PITCHBOOK, THERE
ARE MORE THAN 1000 UNICORNS OR
STARTUPS WITH OVER $1 BILLION IN
VALUATION, AND THE VAST MAJORITY
OF UNICORNS OVER 80% CHOOSE AWS
LIKE WIZ, A CLOUD SECURITY
COMPANY AND GREAT AWS PARTNER.
WIZ IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST CYBER
SECURITY UNICORN AND FASTEST
SAAS COMPANY. TO REACH A $10
BILLION VALUATION. REALLY
AMAZING OR ULTIMATE GENOMICS,
ONE OF FAST COMPANY'S MOST
INNOVATIVE COMPANIES IN BIOTECH
AND ULTIMO IS REVOLUTIONIZING
DNA SEQUENCING BY REDUCING THE
COST OF SEQUENCING SIX FOLD OR
PLAID PLAIDS. A DATA STARTUP
THAT POWERS FINTECH TOOLS LIKE
VENMO, ACORN AND ROBINHOOD THAT
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE USING TO
MANAGE THEIR FINANCES. CUSTOMERS
OF EVERY SIZE, EVERY INDUSTRY,
ORI, EVERY REGION, ORGANIZATIONS
YOU MIGHT NEVER IMAGINE CHAN
WOULD RELY ON THE CLOUD ARE
INNOVATING ON AWS. I JUST
RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT LOUDEN
GUITARS, A K10 EXPERT GUITAR
MAKER LOCATED IN A TINY VILLAGE
IN IRELAND, AND THEY'RE USING
AWS TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN
ELECTRONIC PASSPORT PROGRAM
THAT'S GOING TO EASE THE PASSAGE
OF THEIR VERY SPECIAL GUITARS
FOR MUSICIANS AS THEY TRAVEL
THROUGH CUSTOMS. I MEAN, ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES. IT'S AMAZING
ENTERPRISE WIZ AND STARTUPS,
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED
BUSINESSES, UNIVERSITIES,
COMMUNITY COLLEGES, GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, NONPROFITS. THE CLOUD
IS FOR ANYONE AND OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE SOLVING BIG PROBLEMS,
SERVING CRITICAL NEEDS AND
DREAMING UP THE WORLD'S NEXT BIG
THING. THEY COUNT ON US TO BE
SECURE, TO BE RELIABLE, TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY, TO DELIGHT
THEIR CUSTOMERS AND ENABLE NEW
WAYS TO GROW THEIR BUSINESSES.
ALL ALL ON AWS. SO WHY IS ALL
THIS HAPPENING? ON AWS, WE ARE
RELENTLESS ABOUT WORKING
BACKWARDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS
NEEDS AND FROM THEIR PAIN
POINTS. AND OF COURSE WE WERE
THE FIRST BY ABOUT 5 TO 7 YEARS
TO HAVE THIS BROADEST AND
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES THAT
WE STILL HAVE TODAY. AND WE'RE
THE MOST SECURE AND THE MOST
RELIABLE, BUT WE ALSO THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS
PROBLEMS AND THEIR POTENTIAL.
AND THIS HAS LED US TO REINVENT
CONTINUOUS ALI, TO PUSH THROUGH
THE BARRIERS OF WHAT PEOPLE
THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. SO YOU CAN
DO THE SAME. REINVENTING IS IN
OUR DNA AND IT CONTINUES TO
DRIVE US EVERY DAY. AFTER ALL,
THIS IS HOW CLOUD COMPUTING CAME
TO BE. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF
OPERATING OPERATING AMAZON.COM.
WE EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND HOW
HARD, HOW EXPENSIVE IT WAS TO
PROVISION AND MANAGE
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW MUCH OF
THE UNDIFFERENTIATED HEAVY
LIFTING THERE WAS THAT
DISTRACTED, REALLY TALENTED
TEAMS FROM REALLY INNOVATING. SO
WE SET OUT TO RETHINK IT.
INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETELY WITH
AWS. SO EVERYONE, EVEN A KID AND
A COLLEGE DORM ROOM, COULD HAVE
ACCESS TO THE SAME POWERFUL
TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO THE
LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED
ORGANIZATIONS. ALL ON DEMAND,
ALL SECURE, ALL RELIABLE AND ALL
COST EFFECTIVE. NOW IF FOLKS GOT
PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AS
THEY MOVED INTO THE CLOUD, SOME
EVEN HOSTED DATA CENTER CLOSING
PARTIES AND POSTED VIDEOS OF
SHUTTING DOWN SERVER ROOMS. IT
WAS REALLY, REALLY FUN. THIS WAS
FUN FOR US. SO WE INVENTED
REINVENTED INFRASTRUC FROM THE
GROUND UP TO OPTIMIZE AWS FOR
SCALE, FOR SECURITY, FOR
RELIABILITY, FROM ROUTERS TO
COOLING SYSTEMS TO NETWORKING
PROTOCOLS. AND BECAUSE WE LOOK
AT THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, OUR
GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE WAS
FUNDAMENTALLY DISTINCT FROM THAT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS. AND
THAT IS STILL TRUE TODAY. FOR
EXAMPLE, THE AWS GLOBAL
INFRASTRUCTURE SPANS 32
GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AROUND THE
WORLD AND WE'VE ANNOUNCED PLANS
FOR FIVE OR SO MORE EACH AND
EVERY REGION CONSISTS OF THREE
OR MORE AVAILABILITY ZONES OR
AZS AND NO OTHER CLOUD PROVIDER
PROVIDES THAT IN EVERY SINGLE
GEOGRAPHIC REGION. AND THIS IS
CRITICAL WITH EACH REGION. THE
AZS ARE PHYSICALLY SEPARATED BY
A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE UP TO 60
MILES OR 100KM. AND THEN THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH REDUNDANT
FIBER NETWORK THAT PROVIDES
SINGLE DIGIT MILLISECOND
LATENCY. NOW EACH AZ IS AT LEAST
ONE FULLY DISCRETE DATA CENTER
WITH ITS OWN REDUNDANT POWER
WATER FOR NETWORKING AND
CONNECTIVITY. SO IF THERE'S A
UTILITY FAILURE, UNEXPECTED
TRAFFIC SPIKE, HUMAN MISTAKE OR
EVEN A NATURAL DISASTER, THE
REGION REMAINS OPERATIONAL AND
SO DO YOUR APPLICATIONS. NOW,
OTHERS WOULD HAVE YOU THINK THAT
ALL CLOUDS ARE THE SAME, BUT
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. I MEAN,
IMAGINE IF YOU HAD A REGION
SUPPORTED BY A SINGLE DATA
CENTER OR IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR
PROVIDER HAD MULTIPLE AZS IN
FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND YOU
WERE RESILIENT. BUT IT TURNED
OUT THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THE
SAME LOCATION. I MEAN, ONE
INCIDENT LIKE A WATER LEAK
FOLLOWED BY A FIRE COULD TAKE
DOWN AN ENTIRE REGION FOR DAYS
DUE. HAVING THE BROADEST AND THE
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES
MATTERS LIKE HAVING THREE TIMES
THE THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF
DATA CENTERS COMPARED TO THE
NEXT LARGEST CLOUD PROVIDER,
WHICH MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN
CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY AND
HAVING 60% MORE SERVICES IN OVER
40% MORE FEATURES THAN THE NEXT
CLOSEST CLOUD PROVIDER. SO YOU
CAN INNOVATE WITHOUT
CONSTRAINTS. WE REINVENT IT SO
THAT YOU CAN REINVENT, TAKE
STORAGE, FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE
CERTAINLY DIDN'T INVENT STORAGE,
BUT WE REINVENTED HOW PEOPLE
CONSUME AND SCALE STORAGE IN THE
CLOUD WITH OUR VERY FIRST CLOUD
SERVICE, AMAZON S3, SIMPLE
STORAGE SERVICE SO BACK IN THE
DAY, STORAGE WAS PRIMARILY DISK
ARRAYS, WHICH COULD TAKE WEEKS
TO PROVISION AND OBVIOUSLY HAD
FINITE CAPACITY. SO S3 PROVIDED
HIGHLY DURABLE, HIGHLY
PERFORMANT OBJECT STORAGE THAT
CUSTOMERS COULD SCALE INSTANTLY
AND NEARLY INFINITELY. AND I
REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT S3 AT OUR
VERY FIRST TRADE SHOW IN 2006,
ON THE DAY THAT IT LAUNCHED, AND
FOLKS HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING
THE COST. I MEAN, IT WAS SO
DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN WHAT
THEY WERE USED TO, BUT WE KEPT
GOING. WE ADDED A WHOLE LOT OF
STORAGE TIERS, INCLUDING S3
GLACIER, DEEP ARCHIVE, WHICH
DELIVERS ARCHIVE STORAGE AT LESS
THAN A 10TH OF A CENT PER
GIGABYTE. BUT WHY SHOULD YOU
HAVE TO EVEN FIGURE OUT WHICH
STORAGE TIER TO USE? SO WE BUILT
S3 INTELLIGENT-TIERING TO
OPTIMIZE STORAGE BY
AUTOMATICALLY MOVING DATA TO THE
MOST EFFECTIVE ACCESS TIER WHEN
ACCESS PATTERNS CHANGE.
INTELLIGENT-TIERING HAS ALREADY
SAVED CUSTOMERS. YOU READY? OVER
$2 BILLION, BUT IT'S JUST
STORAGE, RIGHT? I MEAN, HERE'S
TO THE SAVINGS. BUT STORAGE,
RIGHT? I MEAN, SURELY THIS CAN'T
BE AN AREA THAT'S READY FOR MORE
REINVENTION. WELL, RECENTLY
WE'VE BEEN RETHINKING STORAGE
FOR YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED AND MOST LATENCY
SENSITIVE WORKLOADS, WORKLOADS
THAT NEED HIGH PERFORMANCE
ANALYTICS PROCESSING, LIKE
FINANCIAL TRADING ANALYTICS,
REAL TIME ADVERTISING, FRAUD
DETECTION AND MACHINE LEARNING
TRAINING. NOW THESE WORKLOADS
ACCESS DATA UP TO MILLIONS OF
TIMES IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AND
DO REQUIRE SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. AND SO
TODAY WHAT HAPPENS IS CUSTOMERS
MOVE DATA OFTEN FROM S3 TO
CUSTOM CACHING SOLUTIONS AND
THEN RUN ANALYTICS AT THESE
SPEEDS. BUT MANAGING MULTIPLE
STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURES AND APIS
ADDS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY. SO WE
LOOKED HARD AT WHAT WE COULD DO
TO ADD TO S3 OKAY, ARE YOU READY
FOR THE FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF
THE DAY? OKAY SO TODAY I'M
EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE AMAZON S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE, A NEW S3
STORAGE CLASS PURPOSE BUILT.
PURPOSE BUILT TO OFFER THE
HIGHEST PERFORMANCE AND LOWEST
LATENCY CLOUD OBJECT FOR STORAGE
YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY ACCESSED
DATA. S3 EXPRESS ONE ZONE USES
PURPOSE BUILT HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE TO ACCELERATE DATA
PROCESSING. IT ALSO GIVES YOU
THE OPTION TO ACTUALLY CHOOSE
YOUR AZ FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND
YOU CAN BRING YOUR FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED DATA NEXT TO YOUR HIGH
PERFORMANCE COMPUTE RESOURCE WIZ
TO MINIMIZE LATENCY. SO S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE SUPPORTS
MILLIONS OF REQUESTS PER MINUTE
WITH CONSISTENT SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. THE FASTEST
OBJECT STORAGE IN THE CLOUD AND
UP TO TEN TIMES FASTER THAN S3
STANDARD STORAGE. NOW THE FASTER
DATA PROCESSING LETS YOU SAVE UP
TO 60% ON YOUR COMPUTE COSTS AS
WELL. FOR WORKLOADS THAT REQUIRE
THE HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS
AND THE DATA ACCESS COSTS. ALSO
ARE 50% LOWER THAN S3 STANDARD.
SO YOU CAN RUN THESE WORKLOADS
AT MUCH, MUCH LOWER COST. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, WITH S3 EXPRESS, ONE
ZONE, PINTEREST HAS OBSERVED
OVER TEN TIMES FASTER RIDE
SPEEDS WHILE REDUCED THEIR TOTAL
COST BY 40% FOR ITS MACHINE
LEARNING POWERED VISUAL
INSPIRATION ENGINE. NOW THIS IS
ENABLING THEM TO DO FASTER
EXPERIMENTATION AND
PERSONALIZATION, IMPROVING
EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR USERS. SO
17 YEARS AGO, S3 REINVENTED
STORAGE BY LAUNCHING THE FIRST
CLOUD SERVICE FOR AWS AND WITH
S3 EXPRESS, ONE ZONE, YOU CAN
SEE S3 CONTINUING TO CHANGE HOW
DEVELOPERS USE STORAGE. THE SAME
SIMPLE INTERFACE AND SAME LOW
COST. AND NOW? NOW EVEN FASTER.
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
REINVENTION. GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING. SO WE REALIZED ALMOST
TEN YEARS AGO THAT IF WE WANTED
TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE
ON PRICE PERFORMANCE FOR ALL OF
YOUR WORKLOADS, WE HAD TO
REINVENT GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING FOR THE CLOUD ERA ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO THE SILICON AND
IN 2018, WE BECAME THE FIRST
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER TO DEVELOP
OUR OWN GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTE
PROCESSORS. WHEN WE ANNOUNCED
GRAVITON, OUR SERVER PROCESS OR
CHIP AND CUSTOMERS LOVE THE COST
SAVINGS THAT IT DELIVERED FOR
SCALE OUT WORKLOADS LIKE
MICROSERVICES AND WEB
APPLICATIONS, BUT ASKED FOR MORE
. SO WE BROUGHT YOU GRAVITON2,
WHICH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE SEVEN
FOLD FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF
WORKLOADS AND WE DIDN'T STOP
THERE. OUR CURRENT GENERATION.
GRAVITON THREE DELIVER IS UP TO
25. BETTER COMPUTE PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO GRAVITON2 AND THE
BEST PRICE PERFORMANCE IN EC2.
IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO USES 60%
LESS ENERGY FOR THE SAME LEVEL
OF PERFORMANCE AND THIS IS SO,
SO IMPORTANT TO SO MANY
CUSTOMERS TODAY. AND THAT'S
COMPARED TO COMPARABLE EC2
INSTANCES. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY
IS ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE
IMPORTANT. TODAY. WE'VE GOT OVER
150 GRAVITON BASED INSTANCES
ACROSS THE EC2 PORTFOLIO AND
MORE THAN 50,000 CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING ALL OF THE TOP 100 EC2
CUSTOMERS, USE GRAVITON BASED
INSTANCES TO REALIZE PRICE
PERFORMANCE BENEFITS. FOR
EXAMPLE, SAP, THEY'VE PARTNERED
WITH AWS TO ACTUALLY POWER SAP,
HANA CLOUD WITH GRAVITON AND
WITH GRAVITON. SAP HAS SEEN UP
TO 35% BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
FOR ANALYTICS WORKLOADS AND AIMS
TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT
. THEIR CARBON IMPACT BY AN
ESTIMATED 45. SUPER IMPRESSIVE
OF WE ARE RELENTLESS ABOUT
INNOVATION AND WE CONTINUE TO
PUSH THE ENVELOPE FURTHER. SO
TODAY I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THE LATEST GENERATION OF OUR
GRAVITON PROCESSOR AWS GRAVITON.
FOUR GRAVITON FOUR OR GRAVITON
FOUR IS THE MOST POWERFUL AND
THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT CHIP
THAT WE HAVE EVER BUILT, WITH
50% MORE CORES AND 75% MORE
MEMORY BANDWIDTH THAN GRAVITON.
THREE GRAVITON, FOUR CHIPS ARE
30% FASTER ON AVERAGE THAN
GRAVITON. THREE AND PERFORM EVEN
BETTER FOR CERTAIN WORKLOADS,
LIKE 40% FASTER FOR DATABASE
APPLICATIONS AND 45% FASTER FOR
JAVA APPLICATIONS AS WE WERE THE
FIRST TO DEVELOP AND OFFER OUR
OWN SERVER PROCESSORS, WE'RE NOW
IN OUR FOURTH GENERATION. IN
JUST FIVE YEARS. OTHER CLOUD
PROVIDERS HAVE NOT EVEN
DELIVERED ON THEIR FIRST SERVER
PROCESSORS YET. WE'RE ALSO
ANNOUNCING THE PREVIEW OF OUR
FIRST INSTANCE BASED ON GRAVITON
FOUR RAG INSTANCES AS RAG IS
PART OF OUR MEMORY OPTIMIZED
INSTANCE FAMILY. THEY'RE
DESIGNED TO DELIVER FAST, FAST
PERFORMANCE FOR WORKLOADS. THAT
PROCESS LARGE DATA SETS AND
MEMORY LIKE DATABASES OR REAL
TIME BIG DATA ANALYTICS. RAG
INSTANCES PROVIDE THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY
EFFICIENCY FOR MEMORY INTENSIVE
WORKLOADS AND THERE ARE MANY,
MANY MORE GRAVITON. FOUR
INSTANCES COMING HIGHLY RELIABLE
REGIONS WITH AVAILABILITY ZONES
DURABLE, INSTANTLY SCALABLE, LOW
COST STORAGE, LEADING PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITH CUSTOM DESIGNED
CHIPS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW
EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'RE
REINVENTING TO CONSTANTLY
DELIVER WHAT YOU NEED TO DRIVE
YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE, YOUR
INNOVATION, AND YOUR BUSINESSES.
AND FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES WE
HAVE BEEN SO INTENT ON PROVIDING
YOU WITH THE BROADEST AND
DEEPEST FUNCTIONALITY WITH THE
FAST PACE OF INNOVATION, THE
MOST RELIABLE, THE MOST SECURE
CLOUD SERVICES AND OF COURSE THE
LARGEST AND THE MOST DIVERSE
COMMUNITY OF CUSTOMERS AND
PARTNERS. NOW THESE ADVANTAGES
ARE ALWAYS RELEVANT, BUT NO MORE
SO THAN TODAY, BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALSO THE FOUNDATION FOR
REINVENTING WITH GENERATIVE AI I
NOW HERE TO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
THE BROADEST AND DEEPEST
CAPABILITIES, THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY AND
THE PRIVACY YOU TRUST. YOU NEED
AT ALL. AMAZON HAS BEEN
INNOVATING WITH AI FOR DECADES.
WE USE IT ACROSS THE COMPANY TO
OPTIMIZE THINGS LIKE OUR COMPANY
WIDE SUPPLY CHAIN TO CREATE
BETTER RETAIL SEARCH
CAPABILITIES, WIZ TO DELIVER NEW
EXPERIENCES LIKE AMAZON, ALEXA
OR OUR JUST WALK OUT SHOPPING
TECHNOLOGY. GENAI IS THE NEXT
STEP IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,
AND IT IS GOING TO REINVENT
EVERY APPLICATION THAT WE
INTERACT WITH AT WORK AND AT
HOME. WE'RE READY TO HELP YOU
REINVENT WITH GENERATIVE AI
BECAUSE AGAIN, WE THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES
TO MEET YOUR NEEDS AND WE
REINVENT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND
BECAUSE WE'RE INTIMATELY
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT MEANS TO
REINVENT OURSELVES AS WE
UNDERSTAND HOW TO HELP YOU WITH
YOUR REINVENTIONS. FROM STARTUPS
TO ENTERPRISES, ORGANIZATIONS OF
ALL SIZES ARE GETTING GOING WITH
GENERATIVE AI. THEY WANT TO TAKE
THE MOMENTUM THAT THEY'RE
BUILDING WITH EARLY
EXPERIMENTATION AND TURN IT INTO
REAL WORLD PRODUCTIVITY GAINS
AND INNOVATE, INNOVATE,
INNOVATE. SO WE THINK ABOUT
GENERATIVE AI AS HAVING ACTUALLY
THREE MACRO LAYERS, IF YOU WILL,
OF A STACK. AND THEY'RE ALL
EQUALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE ARE
INVESTING IN ALL THREE OF THEM.
SO THE BOTTOM LAYER IS USED TO
TRAIN FOUNDATION MODELS, OTHER
AND LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, FMS,
WE'LL CALL THEM AND TO RUN THESE
MODELS IN PRODUCTION, THE MIDDLE
LAYER PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE LMS
AND OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
YOU NEED AND ALL THE TOOLS THAT
YOU NEED TO BUILD AND SCALE
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
THEM. AND THEN AT THE TOP LAYER,
WE'VE GOT APPLICATIONS THAT ARE
BUILT USING FMS SO THAT YOU CAN
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GENERATIVE AI
QUICKLY WITHOUT EVEN NEEDING ANY
SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE. SO LET'S
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LAYER
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WITH, WITH,
WITH THE FOUNDATION MODELS,
THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF
WORKLOADS TRAINING AND INFERENCE
AND TRAINING IS TO CREATE AND
PROVE FMS BY LEARNING PATTERNS
FROM LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRAINING,
DATA AND INFERENCE. USE THAT TO
RUN THE MODELS IN PRODUCTION TO
GENERATE AN OUTPUT SUCH AS TEXT
OR IMAGES OR VIDEO. AND THESE
WORKLOADS CONSUME MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF COMPUTE POWER. SO TO
MAKE GENAI GENAI USE CASES
ECONOMICAL AND FEASIBLE, ALL YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR TRAINING, YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR INFERENCE ON
INCREDIBLY PERFORMANT, COST
EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR ML AND AI. NOW
GPUS ARE THE CHIPS THAT CAN
PERFORM A HIGH VOLUME OF
MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS,
SIMULTANEOUS ALI MAKING THEM
POPULAR FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT
WORKLOADS FROM ML SIMULATIONS,
3D RENDERING. AND WE'VE BEEN
COLLABORATING WITH NVIDIA FOR
OVER 13 YEARS TO BRING GPUS TO
THE CLOUD BUILT ON COMPUTE
INSTANCES THAT SUPPORT A WIDE
RANGE OF USE CASES, INCLUDING
GRAPH SIX GAMING HPC, MACHINE
LEARNING, AND NOW OF COURSE
DEMAND AND GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS. IN 2010, AWS WAS THE
FIRST TO BRING NVIDIA GPUS TO
THE CLOUD WITH KG ONE OR THE
CLUSTER GPU INSTANCE. THEN WE
WERE THE FIRST TO OFFER NVIDIA V
100 GPUS WITH OUR P THREE
INSTANCES AND THEN WE WERE AGAIN
THE FIRST TO OFFER THE A 100
TENSOR CORE GPUS WITH OUR P FOUR
INSTANCES IN PRODUCTION AND
EARLIER THIS YEAR, YES, WE WERE
THE FIRST MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER
TO BRING NVIDIA H100 GPUS TO
MARKET WITH OUR P FIVE INSTANCES
AND THE P FIVE ARE PROVIDING
AMAZING PERFORMANCE FOR
TRAINING. THEY'RE UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER AND 40% LESS
EXPENSIVE THAN P FOUR SECONDS.
NOW HAVING THE BEST CHIPS IS
GREAT AND NECESSARY, BUT TO
DELIVER THE NEXT LEVEL OF
PERFORMANCE, YOU NEED MORE THAN
JUST THE BEST GPUS. YOU ALSO
NEED REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE
CLUSTERS OF SERVERS THAT ARE
RUNNING THESE GPUS. OUR GPU
INSTANCES CAN BE DEPLOYED IN EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH UP TO 3200
GIGABITS PER SECOND OF
NETWORKING THROUGH OUR ELASTIC
FABRIC ADAPTER OR EFA. AND THIS
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
20,000 GPUS IN A SINGLE CLUSTER
FOR PROVIDING UP TO 20 EXAFLOPS
OF AGGREGATE COMPUTE COMPUTE
CAPACITY, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO
A SUPERCOMPUTER. AND ALL OF OUR
GPU INSTANCES THAT ARE RELEASED
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS ARE BASED
ON OUR BREAKTHROUGH NITRO
SYSTEM, WHICH REINVENT NOTED
VIRTUALIZATION BY OFFLOADING
STORAGE AND NETWORKING TO
SPECIALIZED CHIPS SO THAT ALL OF
THE SERVICE COMPUTE IS DEDICATED
TO RUNNING YOUR WORKLOADS. AND
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT OTHER
CLOUD PROVIDERS CAN OFFER. AGAIN
NOW WITH NITRO THIS DELIVERS
PERFORMANCE INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM BARE METAL, BUT AT A LOWER
PRICE. AND THE NITRO SYSTEM ALSO
PROVIDES ENHANCED SECURITY THAT
CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS AND
PROTECTS AND VERIFIES THAT THE
INSTANCE HARDWARE AND FIRMWARE
ARE ALL ROBUST. WE'VE WORKED
CLOSELY WITH NVIDIA TO INTEGRATE
OUR NETWORKING AND OUR
VIRTUALIZATION CAPABILITIES WITH
THEIR CHIPS TO BRING OUR GPU
INSTANCES TO CUSTOMERS AND TODAY
I'M THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE
ARE EXPANDING OUR PARTNERSHIP
WITH NVIDIA WITH MORE
INNOVATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO
DELIVER THE MOST ADVANCED
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS WITH, WITH WITH GPUS
AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE JENSEN
HUANG, FOUNDER AND CEO OF NVIDIA
HERE ON STAGE WITH US TO TELL US
MORE. KALLEL JENSEN, SO GOOD TO
SEE YOU. I'M THRILLED TO BE
HERE. YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US TODAY. IT'S
AMAZING. SO AS I'VE JUST
DISCUSSED, WE'VE GOT A LONG
PARTNERSHIP. AWS NVIDIA. I'VE
BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME
TOGETHER AND I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT HOW THE TEAMS ARE
COLLABORATING. YOU AND I WERE
TALKING ABOUT THAT BACKSTAGE.
THE COLLABORATION IS AMAZING.
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LOT OF
YEARS AND I'M JUST THRILLED TO
DEEPEN THE PARTNERSHIP. THANK
YOU. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. I'M
THRILLED TO BE HERE TO CELEBRATE
THE AMAZING WORK OF OUR TWO
TEAMS AND TO HELP ANNOUNCE OUR
BIG NEW PARTNERSHIP. YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR
A VERY LONG TIME. IN FACT, AWS
WAS THE WORLD'S FIRST CLOUD TO
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GPU
ACCELERATED COMPUTING. AND YOU
PUT THE WORLD'S FIRST GPUS IN
THE CLOUD A LONG TIME AGO. AND
SINCE THEN, THIS IS AN AMAZING
STATISTIC. SIX IN THE LAST
SEVERAL YEARS ALONE, JUST FOR
THE AMPERE AND HOPPER GENERATION
WE'VE PUT UP DEPLOYED BOYD TO
MILNE, XEON CPUS IN AWS THAT'S
THREE Z FLOPS. 3000 EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER HOURS MOST YEAH
EXACTLY. YEAH MOST NATIONS WILL
BE HAPPY WITH ONE EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER AND AWS HAS 3000
OF THEM AND WE ARE JUST JUST
GETTING STARTED. I'M DELIGHTED
TO SEE THAT WE ARE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE TODAY A DEPLOYMENT OF A
WHOLE NEW FAMILY OF GPUS, THE L4
, THE L4 IS AND THE BRAND NEW H
200, THE H 200. THIS IS REALLY
AMAZING THING. THE COMBINATION
BETWEEN THE BRAND NEW TENSOR LLM
OPTIMIZING COMPILERS FOR
GENERATIVE AI AND H 200 IMPROVES
THE THROUGHPUT OF IN INFERENCE
LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL INFERENCE
BY A FACTOR OF FOUR REDUCING THE
COST IN JUST ONE YEAR BY A
FACTOR OF FOUR. NOW OUR
COLLABORATION STARTS WITH, OF
COURSE GREAT GPUS AND WE'RE
RAMPING SO INCREDIBLY FAST EACH
QUARTER. WE'RE STANDING UP AND
DEPLOYING MORE THAN ONE SET OF
FLOPS. MORE FOR AN AWS ONE XEN
OF FLOPS MORE EACH QUARTER. IT'S
AN UNBELIEVABLE NUMBER AND ALL
OF THIS IS, OF COURSE, MADE
POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE
ACCELERATED COMPUTING LIBRARIES.
OUR TWO TEAMS STOOD UP A WHOLE
BUNCH OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT
WE'RE ALSO BRINGING OUR MOST
POPULAR LIBRARIES, THE NVIDIA,
AI STACK, OUR NEMO LLM LARGE
LANGUAGE MODEL FRAMEWORK. THE
RETRIEVER FOR INFERENCE MODEL
FOR RAGS, OUR BIO NEMO DIGITAL
BIOLOGY, LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
FOUNDATION MODELS. ISAAC SIM ON
OMNIVERSE FOR ROBOTICS. THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT AMAZON ROBOTICS
USES TO SIMULATE ITS ROBOTS AND
ITS INCREDIBLE WAREHOUSES THAT
YOU GUYS DO. JUST ALL OF THESE
STACKS, SOFTWARE STACKS AND
LIBRARIES WE'RE GOING TO
INTEGRATE INTO AWS. SO OUR TWO
TEAMS HAVE BEEN REALLY, REALLY
BUSY. BUSY INDEED. AND THAT WAS
A LOT OF THAT WAS A LOT OF
ZETAS. AND EVERYTHING. YEAH. SO
AS YOU SAID, THE COLLABORATION
IS GOING TO ENABLE DEVELOPERS TO
ACCESS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY AND
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED IT TO
INNOVATE WITH GENERATIVE AI. NOW
THE ONE OF THE BIG
ANNOUNCEMENTS, OF COURSE, IS
THAT AWS IS GOING TO BE THE
FIRST CLOUD PROVIDER TO BRING
THE LATEST NVIDIA 200
GRACE-HOPPER SUPER CHIPS WITH A
NEW MULTI-NODE NVLINK TO THE
CLOUD FIRST PLACE. AND MAYBE YOU
CAN TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT THAT AND WHAT MAKES THAT
COMPUTING PLATFORM SO POWERFUL
AND HOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER
TO INTRODUCE IT. WELL, WE'RE
BOTH REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT ARM
PROCESSORS AND THE REASON WHY
ARM IS SO INCREDIBLE IS BECAUSE
WE CAN WE CAN MOLD IT TO EXACTLY
THE TYPE OF COMPUTING NEEDS THAT
WE HAVE. IT'S INCREDIBLY LOW
ENERGY. IT'S INCREDIBLY COST
EFFECTIVE. AND SO GRACE-HOPPER,
WHICH IS GX 200, CONNECTS TWO
REVOLUTIONARY PROCESSORS
TOGETHER IN A REALLY UNIQUE WAY.
IT CONNECTS THEM TOGETHER USING
A CHIP TO CHIP INTERCONNECT
CALLED NVLINK AT ONE TERABYTE
BYTES PER SECOND, AND IT'S
CONNECTED IN A COHERENT WAY SO
THAT THE GPU CAN ACCESS ALL OF
THE CPU'S MEMORY. THE CPU CAN
ACCESS ALL OF THE GPU'S MEMORY
AND SO THE TWO OF THESE
PROCESSORS COULD WORK HAND IN
HAND IN A REALLY FAST WAY. THE
SECOND THING THAT WE DID WAS WE
INVENTED A NEW WAY OF EXTENDING
NVLINK TO A VERY LARGE DOMAIN.
SO NOW 32 GRACE HOPPERS COULD BE
CONNECTED BY A BRAND NEW NVLINK
SWITCH, AND THAT BECOMES ONE
UNIT. AND WITH THE NITRO AWS
NITRO THAT BECOMES BASICALLY ONE
GIANT VIRTUAL GPU INSTANCE. I
MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE
THIS. YOU'VE GOT 30 2H2
HUNDREDS. INCREDIBLE HORSEPOWER
IN ONE VIRTUAL INSTANCE BECAUSE
OF AWS NITRO. AND THEN WE
CONNECT IT WITH AWS, EFA YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY FAST NETWORKING ING
ALL OF THESE UNITS NOW CAN
CREATE INTO A ULTRA CLUSTER AND
AWS GLUE CLUSTER. SO I CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE ALL THIS COME
TOGETHER. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE COMBINATION.
I MEAN, HOW CUSTOMERS ARE GOING
TO USE THIS STUFF. ONE CAN ONLY
IMAGINE AND I KNOW THAT THE TH
TWO HUNDREDS ARE REALLY GOING TO
SUPERCHARGE WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE
DOING. IT'S GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE OF COURSE, IN EC2
INSTANCES COMING SOON. NOW IN
THE WORLD OF GENERATIVE AI, A
LOT OF COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO,
UH, TO ONBOARD AI INTO THEIR
BUSINESS AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE
THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT IT
EXTENDS TO THE SOFTWARE, THE
SERVICES AND ALL OF THE OTHER
WORKFLOWS THAT THEY HAVE. SO
THIS LEADS OF COURSE, TO THE
SECOND BIG ANNOUNCEMENT WE HAVE
TODAY. SO PARTNERING NVIDIA TO
BRING THE NVIDIA DGX CLOUD TO
AWS AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE DGX
CLOUD IS IMPORTANT PLATFORM FOR
CUSTOMERS. WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
DGX CLOUD IS NVIDIA'S AI
FACTORY. THIS IS HOW OUR
RESEARCHERS ADVANCE AI. WE USE
AI TO DO NEURAL GRAPHICS. THE
WAY WE DO COMPUTER GRAPHICS
TODAY IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT AI.
WE USE AI TO ADVANCE. WE USE OUR
AI FACTORIES TO ADVANCE OUR
DIGITAL BIOLOGY MODELS, OUR
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS USE IT FOR
ROBOTICS, FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS.
WE USE IT TO SIMULATE EARTH, TO
A DIGITAL TWIN OF THE EARTH, TO
PREDICT WEATHER AND CLIMATE. IT
AND SO THE CLOUD IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO US. WE'RE
INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BUILD THE
LARGEST AI FACTORY NVIDIA HAS
EVER BUILT. WE'RE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE INSIDE OUR COMPANY WE
CALL IT PROJECT CIBA CIBA. YOU
ALL PROBABLY KNOW SINCE YOU'RE
AT A CONFERENCE IS THE LARGEST,
MOST MAGNIFICENT TREE IN THE
AMAZON. WE CALL IT PROJECT CIBA.
CIBA IS GOING TO BE 16,000 AND
16,384 GPUS CONNECTED INTO ONE
GIANT AI SUPERCOMPUTER. FOR THIS
IS UTTERLY INCREDIBLE. WE WILL
BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE TRAINING
TIME OF THE LARGEST LANGUAGE
MODELS. THE NEXT GENERATION
MOISES THESE LARGE EXTREMELY
LARGE MIXTURE MIXTURE OF
EXPERTS, MODELS AND BE ABLE TO
TRAIN IT IN JUST HALF OF THE
TIME, ESSENTIALLY REDUCE THE
COST OF TRAINING IN JUST ONE
YEAR IN HALF. NOW WE'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO TRAIN MUCH, MUCH
LARGER MULTI-MODAL MO MODELS
THIS NEXT GENERATION, LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS, THESE 16,000
GPUS WILL BE 65 EXAFLOPS. IT'S
LIKE 65 EXASCALE SUPERCOMPUTERS
IN ONE. AND SO I CAN'T WAIT FOR
US TO STAND THIS UP. OUR AI
RESEARCHERS ARE CHOMPING AT THE
BIT. NOW, OF COURSE, THIS IS
ALSO A PLACE WHERE WE
COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS AND
CUSTOMERS WHO NEED TO BUILD
CUSTOM AI MODELS. YOU KNOW, IT'S
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO USE OFF THE
SHELF MODELS AND THERE'S BE A
WHOLE BUNCH OF OFF THE SHELF
MODELS IN PUBLIC CLOUDS. IT'S
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN A
SOFTWARE PLATFORM. COMPANIES,
SAAS COMPANIES, FOR EXAMPLE,
SALESFORCE THAT YOU MENTIONED
EARLIER, THEY'LL HAVE ALL KINDS
OF OFF THE SHELF COPILOTS AND
GENERATIVE AI MODELS. BUT A LOT
OF COMPANIES NEED TO BUILD THEIR
OWN PROPRIETARY MODELS. AND SO
WE SET UP THE AI FACTORY. SO
THAT WE COULD PARTNER WITH THEM
TO HELP THEM CREATE THEIR CUSTOM
AIS, AND NOW THEY'LL RUN ALL ON
AWS. WE'LL DEVELOP THE MODEL ON
AWS, COLLABORATE WITH OUR
CUSTOMERS ON AWS, CONNECT THEM
ALL TO YOUR SERVICES AND STORAGE
SERVICES, SECURITY SERVICES AND
ALL KINDS OF OTHER GENERATIVE AI
SERVICES AND THEN DEPLOY IT ALL
IN AWS. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO DO THIS VERY FIRST TIME
IN AWS. IT'S ALL AMAZING. I
MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING
AMAZING THINGS. WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD TO SEE US COME
TOGETHER EVEN MORE TIGHTLY. I
MEAN, IT'S JUST GOING TO BRING
INCREDIBLE BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS
WHO ARE REALLY GOING TO NEED IT.
WE APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION,
APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU AND
LOOK FORWARD TO A LOT MORE OF
THAT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU,
ADAM. THANK YOU. JENSEN. HAVE A
GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. IT'S BEEN
A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. WE REALLY
APPRECIATED IT. NOW LET'S TALK
ABOUT CAPACITY OR ACTUALLY
GETTING ACCESS TO ALL OF THAT
AMAZING COMPUTE. SO CUSTOMERS
WHO WANT TO BUILD AND TRAIN
MODELS OFTEN NEED LARGE AMOUNTS
OF RELIABLE CLUSTERED CAPACITY.
IT HAS TO BE TOGETHER OR IN
CLUSTERS, BUT THEY DON'T
NECESSARILY NEED THE SAME AMOUNT
OF IT ALL THE TIME.
FOR EXAMPLE, CUSTOMERS TRAINING A MODEL. I
MEAN, THEY MIGHT STOP TO
EVALUATE NEWS, USE NEW TRAINING
DATA OR MAKE OTHER CHANGES, AND
THEN THEY WANT TO DO MORE
TRAINING. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS
THAT THEY OFTEN NEED SHORT TERM
CLUSTERED CAPACITY AND IT'S
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NO ONE, NO
CLOUD HAS BEEN ADDRESSING UNTIL
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
FOR ML AND EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
WERE THE FIRST CONSUMPTION MODEL
IN THE INDUSTRY THAT ENABLES ANY
CUSTOMER TO RESERVE THE HIGHLY
SOUGHT AFTER GPU CAPACITY TO RUN
FOR SHORT DURATION MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS. AND THIS
ELIMINATES THE NEED TO HOLD ON
TO THE CAPACITY HOLDING CAPACITY
THAT THEY'RE USING JUST SO THEY
CAN BE CERTAIN THAT THEY CAN USE
IT LATER IF THEY NEED TO USE IT
LATER. NOW EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
ARE DEPLOYED IN ULTRACLUSTERS
INTERCONNECTED WITH OUR EFA
NETWORKING THAT WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THIS MORNING AND THAT
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
HUNDREDS OF GPUS IN A SINGLE
CLUSTER WITH THIS NEW OFFERING.
SO WITH THE CAPACITY BLOCKS,
CUSTOMERS CAN PLAN FOR THEIR ML
WORKLOAD DEPLOYMENTS WITH
CERTAINTY AND THEY KNOW THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE GPU
CAPACITY WHEN THEY NEED IT AND
ONLY WHEN THEY NEED IT. NOW
SUPPORT FOR THE LATEST
GENERATION. HIGH PERFORMANCE
GPUS COMBINED WITH OUR
INNOVATIONS, VIRTUALIZATION,
NETWORKING, CLUSTER MANAGEMENT.
THESE ARE REASONS WHY AWS IS THE
BEST PLACE TO RUN GPUS IN THE
WORLD, BUT TO DRIVE INNOVATION
AND THE BROAD CHOICES THAT OUR
CUSTOMERS WANT IN ML AND AI, WE
REALIZED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT
AGAIN HERE IS ANOTHER PLACE WE'D
HAVE TO INNOVATE ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO THE SILICON, JUST LIKE
WE DID WITH GRAVITON FOR GENERAL
PURPOSE COMPUTING AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT TRAINIUM AND INFERENTIA
. SO TRAINIUM IS OUR PURPOSE
BUILT CHIP FOR TRAINING, MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS, MACHINE
LEARNING MODELS AND INFERENTIA
IS OUR CHIP OPTIMIZED FOR
RUNNING INFERENCE ON THOSE
MODELS? SO EARLIER THIS YEAR WE
ALREADY ANNOUNCED THE SECOND
GENERATION OF OUR INFERENTIA
CHIP INFERENTIA TO AND BECAUSE
WE OPTIMIZE FOR INFERENCE, THE
TWO INSTANCES POWERED BY
INFERENTIA TO ARE OFFER THE BEST
LOWEST COST INFERENCE IN EC2
WHILE ALSO DELIVERING UP TO FOUR
TIMES HIGHER THROUGHPUT AND TEN
TIMES LOWER LATENCY COMPARED TO
THE INF1 INSTANCES. CUSTOMERS
LIKE ADOBE, DEUTSCHE TELEKOM,
LEONARDO, AI, THEY'VE ALL SEEN
GREAT EARLY RESULTS AND THEY ARE
DEPLOYING THEIR GENERATIVE AI AI
MODELS AT SCALE WITH INFERENTIA
TO. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF
INTEREST IN TRAINIUM AS WELL.
OUR TRN1 INSTANCES POWERED BY
TRAINIUM HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED BY A
LOT OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
ANTHROPIC PARTNERS LIKE
DATABRICKS AND RICOH AND OUR OWN
AMAZON SEARCH TEAM USES TRN1
INSTANCES TO TRAIN TRAIN A
LARGE, DEEP, LARGE SCALE, DEEP
LEARNING MODELS. THEY'RE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF A TRAINIUM HIGH
PERFORMANCE SCALE RELIABILITY
AND LOW COST. BUT AS CUSTOMERS
CONTINUE TO TRAIN BIGGER AND
BIGGER MODELS ON LARGER AND
LARGER DATA SETS, WE REALIZED WE
NEEDED TO KEEP PUSHING AND
PUSHING OUR PRICE PERFORMANCE.
WE'RE NEVER DONE THERE. AND
TODAY I'M REALLY EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE AWS TRAINIUM TO OUR
SECOND GENERATION. IT'S OUR
SECOND GENERATION CHIP. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR HIGH
PERFORMANCE TRAINING OF
FOUNDATION MODELS, TRAINING IS
DESIGNED TO DELIVER UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO OUR FIRST GENERATION
CHIPS AND THAT MAKES IT IDEAL
FOR TRAINING FOUNDATION MODELS
WITH HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OR
EVEN TRILLIONS OF PARAMETERS.
TRAINIUM TWO IS GOING TO POWER
THE NEXT GENERATION OF EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND WILL DELIVER
UP TO 65 EXAFLOPS OF AGGREGATE
COMPUTE AND WE EXPECT THE FIRST
TRAINIUM TWO BASED INSTANCES ARE
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR
AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO DO
WITH THEM. MEANWHILE ALL A LOT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS ARE
STILL JUST TALKING ABOUT THEIR
OWN. ML CHIPS. WE'VE ALSO MADE A
LOT OF EXCITING PROGRESS IN
BUILDING THE SOFTWARE TOOLCHAIN
THAT SUPPORTS TRAINIUM IN
INFERENTIA. SO AWS NEURON IS OUR
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT THAT
HELPS CUSTOMERS GET MAXIMUM
PERFORMANCE FROM ML CHIPS. NEW
RON SUPPORTS MACHINE LEARNING
FRAMEWORKS LIKE TENSORFLOW
PYTORCH WITH JAX SUPPORT COMING
REALLY SOON AND SO CUSTOMERS CAN
USE THEIR EXISTING KNOWLEDGE TO
BUILD TRAINING AND INFERENCE
PIPELINES WITH JUST A FEW LINES
OF CODE AND NEURON SUPPORTS THE
MOST POPULAR MODELS, INCLUDING
93 OF THE TOP 100 AND COUNTING.
IMPORTANTLY, YOU ALSO NEED THE
RIGHT TOOLS TO HELP TRAIN AND
DEPLOY YOUR MODELS AND THIS IS
WHY WE HAVE AMAZON SAGEMAKER OUR
MANAGED SERVICE. THAT MAKES IT
EASY FOR DEVELOPERS TO TRAIN,
TUNE, BUILD, MANAGE MACHINE
LEARNING AND FOUNDATION MODELS.
IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE WE
LAUNCHED SAGEMAKER, WE'VE
INTRODUCED A LOT OF POWERFUL
INNOVATIONS LIKE AUTOML MODEL
TUNING, DISTRIBUTED TRAINING,
FLEXIBLE MODEL DEPLOYMENT TOOLS
FOR ML OPS AND BUILT IN FEATURES
LIKE RESPONSIBLE AI. SAGEMAKER
HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN
DEMOCRATIZING ML FOR TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING STABILITY AI AI21LABS
LABS, THOMSON REUTERS,
ASTRAZENECA, 3M, HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AWS,
FERRARI AND MORE, AND SAGEMAKER
CAN TRAIN MODELS WITH UP TO
BILLIONS OF PARAMETERS FOR
EXAMPLE, TI HAS TRAINED 180
BILLION PARAMETER FALCON FM,
WHICH IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MODEL ON
SAGEMAKER USING 3000 GPUS AND
PETABYTES OF PETABYTES OF DATA
STORED IN S3. AND YOU CAN ALSO
DEPLOY THIS TOP RANKED MODEL
USING SAGEMAKER. WE'VE ALSO BEEN
WORKING CLOSELY WITH HUGGINGFACE
TO SUPPORT THEIR MODELS ON
SAGEMAKER AND HAVE COLLABORATED
TO CREATE THE HUGGING FACE DEEP
LEARNING CONTAINERS TO HELP
ACCELERATE TRAINING AND
DEPLOYMENT OF FMS USING
SAGEMAKER, TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA. SO IF YOU'RE
BUILDING YOUR OWN MODELS. AWS IS
RELENTLESSLY FOCUSED ON
EVERYTHING YOU NEED THE BEST
CHIPS, THE MOST ADVANCED
VIRTUALIZATION, POWERFUL
PETABYTE SCALE NETWORKING
CAPABILITIES, HYPER SCALE
CLUSTERING AND THE RIGHT TOOLS
TO HELP YOU BUILD. BUT OF
COURSE, AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF
ORGANIZATIONS JUST WANT TO BE
ABLE TO ACCESS THE MOST POWERFUL
MODELS OUT THERE. THEY WANT TO
GET STARTED QUICKLY,
EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT FMS
AND TESTING DIFFERENT USE CASES
AND TO MEET THE ENORMOUS
OPPORTUNITY HEAD ON. BUT THEY
ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH
MODEL SHOULD I EVEN USE AND HOW
DO I DECIDE WHICH ARE BEST FOR
MY APPLICATION? TITAN HOW CAN I
MOVE QUICKLY TO BUILD AND DEPLOY
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS? JENS
AND HOW CAN I KEEP MY DATA
SECURE AND PRIVATE? THAT'S WHY
WE'RE INVESTING IN THAT MIDDLE
LAYER OF THE STACK. SO NOW WE
KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU NEED IT TO
BE EASIER TO ACCESS A POWERFUL
AND DIVERSE SET OF MODELS. LMS
OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS, AND
THEN TO QUICKLY BUILD
APPLICATIONS WITH THEM ALL THE
TIME, MAINTAINING YOUR SECURITY
AND PRIVACY AND THAT'S WHY WE
BUILT AMAZON BEDROCK SO BEDROCK
IS THE EASIEST WAY TO BUILD AND
SCALE GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS
FOR LMS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS AND CUSTOMERS IN EVERY
INDUSTRY ARE ALREADY USING
BEDROCK TO REINVENT THEIR USER
EXPERIENCES, THEIR PRODUCTS AND
THEIR PROCESSES, AND TO BRING AI
INTO THE HEART OF THEIR
BUSINESSES. SO WHY BEDROCK? SO
FIRST, YOU ENJOY THE BROADEST
CHOICE OF MODELS, MANY OF WHICH
ARE AVAILABLE FIRST OR IN SOME
CASES ONLY ON BEDROCK YOU CAN
ADD YOUR OWN BUSINESS CONTEXT
QUICKLY, EASILY AND PRIVATELY
WITH THE BROADEST SELECTION OF
CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS AND YOU
GET ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
AND PRIVACY. BECAUSE WE DESIGNED
IT THAT WAY FROM DAY ONE. AND
THE CUSTOMER EXCITEMENT HAS BEEN
OVERWHELMING. WE MADE THE
SERVICE GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN
SEPTEMBER AND NOW OVER 10,000
CUSTOMERS ARE USING BEDROCK
AROUND THE WORLD ACROSS
VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY, ADIDAS
HAS ENABLING DEVELOPERS TO GET
QUICK, ACCURATE ANSWERS TO DEEP
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, AS CARRIER
IS USING BEDROCK TO COMBINE
HISTORICAL ACTIONS, PREDICTIVE
ANALYTICS SYSTEMS, ALERTS AND
DATA TRENDS TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THESE ARE
HELPING CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR
ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CUT
CARBON EMISSIONS. NASDAQ IS
USING BEDROCK TO AUTOMATE
INVESTIGATIVE WORKFLOWS ON
SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS AND TO
STRENGTHEN THEIR ANTI ANTI
FINANCIAL CRIME AND SURVEILLANCE
CAPABILITIES. SO MANY MORE,
INCLUDING BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES, CLARIANT COX
AUTOMOTIVE, GODADDY. LEXISNEXIS.
MERCK OMNICOM GROUP ARE ALL
USING BEDROCK. THEY'RE ALL USING
IT TO BUILD GENAI APPLICATIONS.
TODAY BUT IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS.
EVERY ONE IS MOVING FAST,
EXPERIMENTING AND LEARNING. AND
AT THE SAME TIME, THE GENERATIVE
AI TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IS EVOLVING
QUICKLY WITH NEW DEVELOPMENTS
PRACTICALLY EVERY DAY AND
CUSTOMERS ARE FINDING THAT
DIFFERENT MODELS ACTUALLY WORK
BETTER FOR DIFFERENT USE CASES
OR ON DIFFERENT SETS OF DATA.
SOME MODELS ARE GREAT FOR
SUMMARIZATION, OTHERS ARE GOOD
FOR REASONING AND INTEGRATION,
AND STILL OTHERS HAVE AWESOME
LANGUAGE SUPPORT. AND THEN
THERE'S IMAGE GENERATION IN
SEARCH USE CASES AND MORE, ALL
COMING FROM BOTH PROPRIETARY
MODELS AND MODELS THAT ARE
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY.
I MEAN, THINGS ARE MOVING SO
FAST AND IN THAT TYPE OF
ENVIRONMENT THAT THE ABILITY TO
ADAPT IS THE MOST VALUABLE
CAPABILITY THAT YOU CAN HAVE.
THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE
MODEL TO RULE THEM ALL, AND
THERE'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE ONE COMPANY PROVIDING THE
MODELS THAT EVERYBODY USES. SO
YOU DON'T WANT A CLOUD PROVIDER
WHO'S BEHOLDEN PRIMARILY TO ONE
MODEL PROVIDER. YOU NEED TO BE
TRYING OUT DIFFERENT MODELS. YOU
NEED TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH
BETWEEN THEM RAPIDLY OR EVEN
COMBINING THEM WITH THE SAME USE
CASES. AND YOU NEED A REAL
CHOICE OF MODEL PROVIDERS AS YOU
DECIDE WHO'S GOT THE BEST
TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO WHO HAS THE
DEPENDABILITY THAT YOU NEED IN A
BUSINESS PARTNER. I THINK THE
EVENTS OF THE PAST TEN DAYS HAVE
MADE THAT VERY CLEAR. WE'VE BEEN
CONSISTENT ABOUT THIS NEED FOR
CHOICE FOR THE WHOLE HISTORY OF
AWS, AND THAT'S THE APPROACH
THAT WE CLEARLY LAID OUT WHEN WE
STARTED TALKING ABOUT OUR
GENERATIVE AI STRATEGY ALMOST A
YEAR AGO. AND THAT'S WHY WE
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE, TO MAKE
BUILDING AND MOVING BETWEEN A
RANGE OF FOUNDATION MODELS AS
EASY AS AN API CALL. TODAY
BEDROCK PROVIDES ACCESS TO A
WIDE RANGE OF MODELS FROM
LEADERS LIKE I. 21 ANTHROPIC
COHERE STABILITY AI, AS WELL AS
AMAZON'S OWN AMAZON TITAN MODELS
. BUT WE DIDN'T STOP THERE. WE
WERE THE FIRST TO MAKE METIS
LLAMA 2 MODEL AVAILABLE THROUGH
A FULLY MANAGED API. AND WE ALSO
RECENTLY ANNOUNCED OUR EXPANDED
COLLABORATION WITH ANTHROPIC. SO
ANTHROPIC IS A LONG TIME AWS
CUSTOMER AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S
LEADING FOUNDATION MODEL
PROVIDERS. THEIR MODELS CLAUDE
AND THEY GOT OTHERS AS WELL
EXCEL AT A WIDE RANGE OF TASKS
FROM SOPHISTICATED DIALOG AND
CREATIVE CONTENT GENERATION TO
COMPLEX REASONING AND DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS. SO AS PART OF THE
COLLABORATION, ANTHROPIC IS
GOING TO USE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA TO TRAIN FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF THEIR MODELS AND
BEDROCK CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO
HAVE EARLY ACCESS, NOT AVAILABLE
ON OTHER CLOUDS TO UNIQUE
FEATURES FOR MODEL CUSTOMIZATION
AND FINE TUNING CAPABILITIES. SO
TO DIG IN ON WHAT WE'RE DOING
WITH ANTHROPIC, I'D LIKE TO
BRING OUT OUR PARTNER DARIO
OMODEI, WHO'S THE CEO AND
CO-FOUNDER OF ANTHROPIC. LET'S
GIVE HIM A HAND. AS WELL. ALL
RIGHT. WE HAVE CHAIRS. LET'S SIT
. DARIO THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. YEAH.
EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
CLAUDE IS AVAILABLE ON BEDROCK,
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT,
LET'S JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS ABOUT
AND WHAT MAKES CLAUDE SO UNIQUE.
YES SO ANTHROPIC WAS FOUNDED ON
THE IDEA THAT WE CAN MAKE AI
MODELS THAT ARE SAFE, RELIABLE
AND STEERABLE WHILE STILL BEING
HIGHLY CAPABLE. THE FOUNDERS OF
ANTHROPIC WERE A SET OF PEOPLE
WHO WORKED AT OPENAI FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. WE DEVELOPED IDEAS LIKE
GPT THREE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK, SCALING
LAWS FOR LANGUAGE MODELS. SOME
OF THE KEY IDEAS BEHIND THE
CURRENT GENERATIVE AI BOOM.
SEVEN OF US LEFT AND FOUNDED
ANTHROPIC, OUR FOUNDATION MODEL
CLAUDE. IN ADDITION TO BEING
SAFE AND RELIABLE, EXCELS AT A
LOT OF KNOWLEDGE WORK TASKS LIKE
CONTENT, GENERATION,
SUMMARIZATION, Q&A, COMPLEX
REASONING, THINGS LIKE THAT. WE
HAVE AN INDUSTRY LEADING CONTEXT
WINDOW OF 200 K TOKENS. THAT'S
ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH MAKES
IT WELL SUITED FOR AREAS LIKE
LEGAL FINANCE, INSURANCE,
CODING, THINGS LIKE THAT. AND
ABOUT HALF OF THE FORTUNE 500
ARE USING OR ARE TESTING CLAUDE.
SO AMAZING PROGRESS. SO JUST A
FEW MONTHS AGO, OBVIOUSLY AMAZON
AND ANTHROPIC ANNOUNCED KIND OF
AN ENHANCED STRATEGIC
COLLABORATION ANTHROPIC NAMED
AWS IS YOUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO
BE TRAINING AND DEPLOYING FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF CLAUDE AND
FOUNDATION MODELS ON AWS. SO
JUST TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT LED
UP TO THIS AND HOW THAT
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANTHROPIC
AND AWS GROW? YEAH. SO ANTHROPIC
USE OF AWS GOES BACK TO OUR
EARLY HISTORY BACK ALL THE WAY
IN THE MIDST OF TIME IN 2021. WE
CAN REMEMBER THAT, RIGHT? WE
TRAINED OUR FIRST. WE TRAINED
OUR FIRST MODEL ON AWS. AND SO
WE'RE EXCITED NOW TO SAY THAT
YOU GUYS ARE OUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS. I WOULD SAY THE
PARTNERSHIP HAS THREE
COMPONENTS. FIRST IS THE COMPUTE
SIDE, WHICH I JUST DISCUSSED,
WHICH WE'VE BEEN DOING
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY. THE SECOND IS ON THE
PROVISION TO CUSTOMER SIDE.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT
AMAZON BEDROCK WE REALLY
RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THAT WE
COULD PROVIDE TO CUSTOMERS
WORKING TOGETHER AND THE THIRD
SIDE IS THE HARDWARE. WE'RE
CURRENTLY WORKING WITH YOU GUYS
TO OPTIMIZE THESE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA FOR OUR USE CASES AND
HOPEFULLY FOR OTHER USE CASES.
AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE
CAN ACHIEVE THAT FOREX FASTER
THAN THE FIRST GENERATION
TRAINIUM THAT YOU JUST
ANNOUNCED. IF WE OPTIMIZE THESE
THINGS TOGETHER. AND SO PUTTING
TOGETHER THESE THREE PIECES,
LAYERS OF THE STACK REALLY
ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE THINGS TO
CUSTOMERS TOGETHER THAT COULDN'T
BE PROVIDED BEFORE THINGS LIKE
CUSTOMIZATION OF MODELS USE OF
PROPRIETARY DATA AND UNIQUE FINE
TUNING FEATURES. WELL, IT'S THE
RESPECT WE HAVE FOR YOU GUYS IS
JUST TREMENDOUS. I MEAN, TRULY
WORLD CLASS EXPERTISE FOR THE
ANTHROPIC TEAM. I'VE REALLY
ENJOYED WORKING TOGETHER AND THE
MODELS ARE JUST SO POWERFUL. SO
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE AIMING TO AND I
THINK WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
IMPROVING AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES THROUGH
THIS COLLABORATION. TITAN AND OF
COURSE OUR OWN AMAZON DEVELOPERS
ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO ANTHROPIC
MODELS ON BEDROCK AND THROUGHOUT
THE COMPANY. AND WE'RE NOT ONLY
WORKING TO PROVIDE HOOD
CUSTOMERS WITH, WITH, WITH THIS,
BUT WE'RE GIVING THEM EARLY
ACCESS TO UNIQUE FEATURES THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
GET ANYWHERE ELSE. AND WE'RE OUT
THERE TOGETHER WITH OUR
GENERATIVE AI INNOVATION CENTER,
WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE
FIELD, HELPING THEM TO ACTUALLY
GET GET TARGETED. AND THAT'S
ALLOWING US, OF COURSE, TO BRING
THIS EXPERTISE AND THE DOMAIN
SPECIFIC EXPERTISE THAT THEY
NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS.
AND AS WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE
TOGETHER AND IT'S BEEN HOT AND
HEAVY, PARTICULARLY THE PAST FEW
WEEKS, BUT BEFORE THAT AS WELL,
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST
INTERESTING USE CASES THAT
YOU'VE SEEN? YEAH SO I'LL GIVE
THREE EXAMPLES ACROSS DIFFERENT
INDUSTRIES. THERE'S MANY OTHERS,
BUT THIS SHOULD GIVE GIVE A
SENSE OF THE RANGE. AND WE WE'VE
SEEN A LOT OF ORGANIC ADOPTION.
ONE EXAMPLE IN THE BIOMEDICAL
SPACE WE'RE HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE
WE'RE WORKING WITH PFIZER. I'M A
FORMER BIOLOGIST MYSELF, SO I'M
REALLY EXCITED FOR ANY WAY I CAN
CAN ADVANCE MEDICAL SCIENCE AND
BRING BRING LIFE SAVING DRUGS TO
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND THE
LEGAL SPACE. WE MADE A CUSTOM
FINE TUNED MODEL, DEPLOYED IT TO
YOU GUYS FOR LEXISNEXIS TO HELP
WITH THEIR LEGAL SEARCH. YOU
KNOW, IN A WAY THAT'S KIND OF
FACT BASED AND PRODUCE CITATIONS
. AND IN THE FINANCE SPACE,
WE'RE WORKING WITH BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES TO DEVELOP AN
INVESTMENT ANALYST, ASSISTANT.
BUT BEYOND THAT, JUST SOME
EXAMPLES. WE'VE ENGAGED WITH
SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF SOME OF THE
LARGEST PLAYERS IN THE INSURANCE
AND BANKING INDUSTRIES AND, YOU
KNOW, COULD TELL SIMILAR STORIES
ABOUT OTHER INDUSTRIES. SO, YOU
KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE
NEW USE CASES AND WHERE ALL OF
THIS GOES. THAT'S INCREDIBLE
MOMENTUM. JUST THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES EXAMPLE TO BE WORKING
WITH WITH THAT MANY LEADERS. SO
JUST LAST WEEK YOU'RE NOT
STANDING STILL, RIGHT. SO JUST
LAST WEEK YOU ANNOUNCED CLAUDE
2.1. SO THAT'S GOT A WHOLE LOT
OF NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN KEY
CAPABLE CITIES. MAYBE YOU CAN
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.
YEAH. SO CLAUDE 2.1 REALLY IS A
RELEASE THAT'S TARGETED AT
ENTERPRISES. SO A FEW DIFFERENT
FEATURES. ONE IS WE'VE DOUBLED
OUR CONTEXT WINDOW TO 200,000
TOKENS. TOKENS IS A TERM OF ART
IN THE AI SPACE. WHAT IT AMOUNTS
TO IS ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH
IS A RELATIVELY LONG BOOK. AND
SO USE CASES LIKE READING
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, READING AN
ENTIRE LONG BOOK. AND ONE OF MY
FAVORITES, PUTTING MULTIPLE
DOCUMENTS IN THE CONTEXT WINDOW
AND ASKING THE MODEL TO COMPARE
THEM OR INTEGRATE THEM. A SECOND
FEATURE IS THAT WE'VE REDUCED
THE RATE OF SO-CALLED
HALLUCINATIONS, WHICH IS WHEN
MODELS SAY THINGS THAT AREN'T
TRUE TO BY BY ABOUT TWO X WE'VE
SEEN ACROSS THE INDUSTRY A CORE
OBSTACLE TO DEPLOYMENT IN THE
ENTERPRISE WORLD IS PEOPLE ARE
WORRIED THAT MODELS WILL SAY
THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE. NO ONE
HAS PERFECTLY SOLVED THIS
PROBLEM, BUT WE ARE REALLY
LEADING THE WAY IN GETTING MORE
AND MORE REDUCTIONS AND THEN WE
ALSO HAVE SOME BETA FEATURES AS
WE'RE INTRODUCING SYSTEM PROMPTS
FOR TOOL USE AS A BETA FEATURE
AND A DEVELOPER WORKBENCH.
AGAIN, ALL TOOLS TARGETED AT
PEOPLE BUILDING FOR ENTERPRISES.
WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE ALL THE USE
CASES THAT EMERGE FROM THIS. I'M
SPEECHLESS. YES, THAT IS SUCH
INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. YES. I
MEAN, YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU
TALKED ABOUT THE REDUCTION OF
HALLUCINATION, A REALLY
IMPORTANT TOPIC. YOU JUST MORE
BROADLY, I THINK WE SHARE A
BELIEF THAT I SHOULD BE SAFE,
SECURE, RESPONSIBLE AND BENEFIT
SOCIETY. AND WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED
A LOT OF GROUPS AND
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROMOTING
THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT
OF RESPONSIBLE AI IN FACT, I
KEEP BUMPING INTO DARIA AROUND
THE WORLD AT SOME OF THESE
VARIOUS GATHERINGS, WHICH IS
NICE. SO I KNOW THIS IS A
PARTICULAR PASSION OF YOURS. AND
CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT ANTHROPIC WORK IN
THIS AREA? YEAH I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING WE
WERE FOUNDED ON AND THAT WE CARE
ABOUT DEEPLY. WE I WOULD
CATEGORIZE IT INTO TWO AREAS
WHERE WE'VE DONE WORK IN THIS
AREA. ONE IS THE WAY WE DESIGN
OUR OWN MODELS AND THE OTHER IS
THE WAY THAT WE TRY TO SET AN
EXAMPLE FOR THE ECOSYSTEM AND
BRING OTHERS ALONG SO THAT
ULTIMATELY EVERYONE BECOMES
SAFER AND MORE RELIABLE. SO
LARGE FRACTION ON THE FIRST ONE,
A LARGE FRACTION OF OUR RESEARCH
ORG WORKS ON SAFETY. WE PUT A
LOT OF WORK INTO MAKING OUR
MODELS HARD TO BREAK, MAKING
THEM SECURE AGAINST MISUSE AND
HARMFUL USE. THERE WAS A RECENT
STUDY OUT OF CARNEGIE MELLON
WHERE PEOPLE TRIED TO
ADVERSARIALLY BREAK DIFFERENT
MODELS AND IT FOUND THAT THEY
WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY BREAK
CLAUDE TEN TIMES LESS OFTEN THAN
THEY WERE ABLE TO BREAK THE
COMPETITOR'S MODEL. SO THERE'S A
REAL DIFFERENCE HERE. A SECOND
WE'VE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO
INTERPRETABILITY SEEING INSIDE
THE MODELS. THERE'S NO
COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENTS ON THAT
SO FAR. BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG ARC
AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT RELATIVELY
SOON FOR BOTH COMPLIANCE AND FOR
UNDERSTANDING WHAT MODELS DO AND
THEREFORE REDUCING BAD BEHAVIOR
FROM THE MODELS, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE
WIDER ECOSYSTEM. YOU KNOW, WE
ALWAYS TRY TO CREATE A RACE TO
THE TOP, DO SOMETHING, AND THEN
COMPETITORS, OTHER PLAYERS IN
THE ECOSYSTEM, FOLLOW ALONG AND
DO THE SAME THING. AN EXAMPLE OF
THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE SCALING
POLICY WHERE WE FRONT LOADED
SAFETY INVESTMENT AHEAD OF MODEL
SCALING, A KIND OF
PRE-DEPLOYMENT TESTING REGIME
LIKE WHAT'S DONE FOR CARS AND
AIRPLANES. AND IN THE POLICY
SPACE, WE'VE CONTINUALLY
ADVOCATED FOR GOVERNMENTS TO
BUILD UP THEIR ABILITY TO
EVALUATE AND MEASURE AI SYSTEMS
AS IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO EVALUATE
AND MEASURE THINGS, WE'LL GET
EITHER NO REGULATION OR POORLY
INFORMED REGULATION. WE NEED TO
ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE CAN DEVELOP QUICKLY,
RESPONSIBLY, BUT IN A WAY THAT'S
SECURE. I JUST LOVE THE CONCEPT
OF THE RACE TO THE TOP. IT'S SO
POSITIVE. AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS SO AMAZING. I MEAN, WE'VE
SAID IT THE WHOLE 17 YEARS THAT
AWS HAS BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES
THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT GIVES US
ENERGY IS JUST WORKING WITH THE
COOLEST, MOST CUTTING EDGE, YOU
KNOW, STARTUPS AND ENTREPRENEURS
IN THE WORLD. AND THERE IS JUST
NO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN GENERATIVE AI NOW.
AND WHAT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS
DOING. SO IT'S GREAT TO BE
PARTNERING TOGETHER SO DEEPLY
AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
JOINING ME HERE ON STAGE TODAY.
YEAH, EXCITED FOR EVERYTHING WE
CAN DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU. ALL
RIGHT.
ALL RIGHTY. SO THAT'S AMAZING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN, DARIA,
FOR COMING OUT AND JOINING US.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. SO THE
INNOVATION AROUND GENERATIVE AI
MODELS IS EXPLOSIVE AND WE
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
WITH ALL OF OUR BEDROCK PARTNERS
FOR YEARS TO COME. INCREDIBLY
INNOVATIVE SPACE. AND WE'RE ALSO
EXCITED ABOUT THE LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS THAT WE'RE BUILDING
OURSELVES AT AMAZON SO OUR
AMAZON TITAN MODELS WERE CREATED
AND PRE-TRAINED BY AWS, AND
WE'RE BUILDING OUR OWN MODELS IN
ORDER TO BRING ACTUALLY A FEW
BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS. SO WE DO
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE HERE. I
MEAN, AMAZON HAS BEEN WORKING ON
AI FOR 25 YEARS. I'VE GOT A LONG
TRACK RECORD. WE USE THE
TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR BUSINESS
AND WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
BUILDING AND DEPLOYING MODELS.
AND AS A RESULT, WE CAN PROVIDE
A WHOLE RANGE OF MODELS THAT
OFFER REALLY POWERFUL
CAPABILITIES AND ALSO GREAT
ECONOMICS TO SUPPORT A WHOLE
BUNCH OF USE CASES AND WE
CAREFULLY CHOOSE HOW WE TRAIN
OUR MODELS AND THE DATA THAT WE
USE TO DO SO. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY
GOING TO INDEMNIFY CUSTOMERS
AGAINST CLAIMS THAT OUR MODELS
OR THEIR OUTPUTS INFRINGE ON
ANYBODY'S COPYRIGHT. NOW, THERE
ARE ALREADY MULTIPLE MODELS IN
THE TITAN FAMILY. WE'VE GOT
TITAN TEXT LITE, WHICH IS IDEAL
FOR TEXT BASED TASKS LIKE
SUMMARIZATION. WE'VE ALSO GOT
TITAN TEXT EXPRESS, WHICH IS
GREAT FOR MORE ADVANCED GENERAL
LANGUAGE TASKS LIKE COPY
EDITING, COPYWRITING AND WE'VE
ALSO GOT THE TITAN TEXT
EMBEDDINGS MODEL FOR SEARCH USE
CASES OR PERSONALIZATION AND
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ADDING
MODELS TO THE TITAN FAMILY. AND
IF YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT, THEN
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TUNE INTO
SWAMI'S KEYNOTE TOMORROW. A
LITTLE, LITTLE WORD UP NOW, ALL
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE
ALL EXTREMELY CAPABLE AND THEY
ALL ENABLE A LOT OF GREAT
APPLICATIONS. BUT TO REALLY
DRIVE YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED
GENERATIVE AI THAT UNDERSTANDS
YOUR BUSINESS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
CUSTOMERS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
PRODUCTS, YOUR OPERATIONS. AND
THAT'S ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN YOU
USE YOUR OWN DATA TO IMPROVE AND
CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS. THE MODELS
HAVE TO BECOME UNIQUE TO YOU. SO
AMAZON BEDROCK IS GIVING YOU ALL
OF THE PURPOSE BUILT
CAPABILITIES THAT YOU NEED TO
CUSTOMIZE THE AI APPLICATIONS
WITH YOUR OWN DATA. SO WITH A
FEW CLICKS YOU CAN GO FROM
GENERIC APPLICATIONS TO ONES
THAT ARE HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND
HIGHLY TAILORED. SO ONE
IMPORTANT TECHNIQUE IS CALLED
FINE TUNING. NOW, WITH FINE
TUNING, YOU POINT THE MODELS TO
EXAMPLES OF DATA IN S3 THAT
YOU'VE LABELED LABELED TO
PROVIDE CONTEXT. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU MIGHT POINT TO PROPOSALS AND
YOU'VE LABELED SOME OF THOSE
PROPOSALS AS STRONG. SO IN THIS
WAY THE MODEL LEARNS FROM YOU,
LEARNS FROM YOUR DATA. WHAT
MATTERS THE MOST TO YOU. AND
THEN BEDROCK MAKES A COPY OF THE
BASE MODELS. IT TRAINS IT, IT
CREATES A PRIVATE FINE TUNED
MODEL SO YOU GET TAILORED
RESPONSES. SO FINE TUNING IS
AVAILABLE IN AMAZON TITAN TEXT
LITE AND EXPRESS, AND TODAY IT'S
ALSO GENERALLY AVAILABLE FOR
COHERE COMMAND LITE AND META
LLAMA 2 AND FINE TUNING IS
COMING TO ANTHROPIC CLAUDE SOON.
SO A SECOND TECHNIQUE FOR
TAILORING TAILORING FOUNDATION
MODELS FOR YOUR BUSINESS IS
CALLED RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED
GENERATION OR RAG ANOTHER ONE OF
THE TERMS YOU SEE OUT THERE A
LOT. SO RAG ALLOWS YOU TO
CUSTOMIZE A MODEL'S RESPONSES
WHEN YOU WANT THE MODEL TO
CONSIDER NEW KNOWLEDGE OR UP TO
DATE INFORMATION. SO BEDROCK
DOES THIS FOR YOU BY CALLING AND
BRINGING BACK YOUR OWN DATA,
YOUR DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES,
INCLUDING DOCUMENT REPOSITORIES,
DATABASES AND OTHER APIS AND
MORE SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MODEL
MIGHT USE RAG TO RETRIEVE SEARCH
RESULTS FROM OUR AMAZON
OPENSEARCH SERVICE OR DOCUMENTS
FROM S3. AND IN SEPTEMBER, WE
INTRODUCED A RAG CAPABILITY
CALLED KNOWLEDGE BASES THAT
CONNECTS FM TO YOUR PROPRIETARY
DATA SOURCES TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR
PROMPTS WITH MORE INFORMATION
AND TODAY KNOWLEDGE BASES IS
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NOW, A
THIRD WAY THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE
MODELS INSIDE OF BEDROCK IS A
TECHNIQUE CALLED CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING. SO CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT
USES LARGE AMOUNTS OF UNLABELED
DATA BEFORE YOU FINE TUNE IT.
YOU DID THE LABELED DATA HERE IS
UNLABELED DATA LIKE THE RAW TEXT
OF INTERNAL REPORTS, FINANCIAL
PLANS OR RESEARCH RESULTS THAT
YOU HAVE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE
USED TO IMPROVE THE MODELS,
KNOWLEDGE AND ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES USING THINGS IN
YOUR OWN SPECIFIC DOMAIN. SO
CONTINUED PRE-TRAINING IS OF
COURSE AVAILABLE IN BEDROCK
TODAY. NOW ALL OF THESE
TECHNIQUES, THEY'RE ALL POWERFUL
TOOLS IN MAKING GENERATIVE AI
TARGETED, MAKING IT TRULY USEFUL
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND BEDROCK
MAKES IT REALLY EASY TO COMBINE
THESE TECHNIQUES TOGETHER. SO A
GREAT EXAMPLE OF A CUSTOMER
USING BEDROCK TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR
GENERATIVE AI AI APPLICATIONS IS
DELTA AIRLINES. SO DELTA IS
ACTUALLY MODERNIZING ITS
CUSTOMER SERVICE CAPABILITY WITH
GENERATIVE AI AI BUILT ON AMAZON
BEDROCK. THE NEW TOOL IS GOING
TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS IN A MORE RELEVANT AND
CONVERSATIONAL STYLE BY
ACCESSING DELTA'S TRAVEL
POLICIES, REAL TIME FLIGHT
SCHEDULES, CUSTOMER REBOOKING
OPTIONS AND AIRPORT CONDITIONS.
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD
RESPOND TO SIMPLE QUESTIONS LIKE
HOW MANY BAGS CAN I CHECK ON A
DELTA FLIGHT? AND IT CAN ALSO DO
MORE COMPLEX QUESTIONS LIKE CAN
I CARRY MY CAT WITH ME IN THE
CABIN TO JAMAICA? OF COURSE.
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH YOUR CAT?
DELTA'S BEEN
TESTING WITH DIFFERENT
FOUNDATION MODELS IN BEDROCK,
INCLUDING ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 2.0
CLAUDE INSTANT AND A FINE TUNED
AMAZON TITAN TEXT EXPRESS MODEL.
AND THIS WAY THEY CAN USE THE
RIGHT MODEL TO ANSWER DIFFERENT
CUSTOMER QUESTIONS IN. IT'S A
REALLY POWERFUL HOW THEY CAN
COMBINE THE MOST RELEVANT
INFORMATION NEEDED TO ANSWER ANY
SPECIFIC QUESTION. NOW, WITH THE
NEW CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOL
DELTA AIRLINES IS AIMING TO
PROVIDE A DELIGHTFUL AND
CONVERSATIONAL SELF-SERVICE
EXPERIENCE AND IT'S GOING TO
IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SO
EVERYONE WANTS MORE RELEVANT
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS,
RIGHT? AND BEDROCK IS MAKING IT
A LOT EASIER TO CUSTOMIZE THOSE
APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR OWN DATA.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU
WANT FMS TO DO MORE THAN JUST
PROVIDE USEFUL AND TARGETED
INFORMATION AND ULTIMATELY WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT IS TO USE
FMS TO TAKE ACTION TO ACTUALLY
GET THINGS DONE AND WE WANTED
YOU TO BE ABLE TO USE BEDROCK TO
COMPLETE ACTIONS LIKE BOOKING
TRAVEL, FILING INSURANCE CLAIMS,
DEPLOYING SOFTWARE, MAYBE
ORDERING REPLACEMENT PARTS. AND
THIS USUALLY REQUIRES
ORCHESTRATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE
SYSTEMS THAT OPERATE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S WHY A
FEW MONTHS AGO, WE INTRODUCED
AGENTS FOR BEDROCK. AND TODAY
I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS
POWERFUL FEATURE IS TODAY.
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. NOW WITH
AGENTS GENAI APPLICATIONS CAN
EXECUTE MULTI-STEP TASKS ACROSS
COMPANY SYSTEMS AND DATA SOURCES
FROM ANSWERING CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS ABOUT PRODUCT
AVAILABLE IOT TO TAKING A SALES
ORDER AND MORE AND BUILDING WITH
AGENTS IS REALLY EASY. FIRST,
YOU USE BEDROCK SETUP WIZARD TO
SELECT THE APPROPRIATE MODEL.
THEN YOU GIVE THE MODEL BASIC
INSTRUCTIONS TO HELP THE MODEL
UNDERSTAND HOW TO RESPOND. LIKE
YOU ARE A FRIENDLY CUSTOMER
SERVICE AGENT WHO HELPS
CUSTOMERS RETURN ITEMS. NEXT,
YOU SPECIFY THE LAMBDA FUNCTIONS
THAT EXECUTE THE API CALLS TO
RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION THAT'S
RELEVANT TO THE TASK. FOR
EXAMPLE, RETURN POLICIES OR
INVENTORY LEVELS. AND FINALLY,
YOU SELECT THE DATA SOURCES.
THEN YOU JUST SELECT, CREATE
AGENT AND BEDROCK, CONFIGURES
YOUR AGENT AND IT IS NOW READY
TO RUN WHEN THE AGENT RECEIVES A
REQUEST, IT USES ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES TO ANALYZE AND TO
PLAN THE TASK. AND THE MODEL
WORKS OUT THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS.
THE INFORMATION NEEDED, THE APIS
TO CALL AND WHEN TO CALL THEM.
THEN IT EXECUTE BETZ THE PLAN,
TAKING ALL THE STEPS THAT IT
NEEDS TO GATHER THE INFORMATION
AND THEN COMPLETE THE TASK. ALL
IN THE BACKGROUND. NO NEED TO
ENGINEER PROMPT, NO NEED TO
TRAIN THE FMS. NO NEED TO
MANUALLY CONNECT SYSTEMS WITH
AGENTS. GENERATIVE AI IS
BECOMING AN INTEGRAL PART OF
YOUR BUSINESS. MAKING IT EASY TO
TAKE ACTIONS AND GET TASKS DONE.
NO HEAVY LIFTING REQUIRED SO
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW BEDROCK
IS MAKING IT EASY TO CHOOSE
AMONGST LEADING MODELS AND ALSO
HOW IT GIVES YOU SO MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA AND HOW IT CAN
HELP COMBINE THE POWER OF MODELS
INTO YOUR ORGANIZATION'S
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA'S AND YOUR
API TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION. BUT
YOU WON'T ACTUALLY USE ANY OF
THIS IN A SERIOUS WAY IF IT
ISN'T SECURE AND PRIVATE.
I MEAN, YOU DEMAND THE
SAME ROCK SOLID RELIABILITY. THE
SAME SECURITY FOR GENERATIVE AI
THAT YOU DO FOR ANY WORKLOAD,
AND YOU REALLY NEED THIS TO HAVE
NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS
THAN EVERYTHING YOU EXPECT FROM
AN AWS SERVICE. IT'S JUST LIKE
S3. EC2. RDS. BEDROCK HAS GOT TO
HAVE ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
FEATURES TO MAKE YOUR DATA SAFE
AND PRIVATE, AND THAT'S WHAT IT
HAS. BEDROCK CUSTOMERS CAN TRUST
THAT THEIR DATA REMAINS
PROTECTED. NO CUSTOMER DATA IS
GOING TO BE USED TO TRAIN OR
IMPROVE THE ORIGINAL BASE
MODELS. WHEN YOU TUNE A MODEL,
WE MAKE A PRIVATE COPY OF THAT
MODEL. WE PUT IT IN A SECURE
CONTAINER AND IT GOES NOWHERE.
YOUR DATA IS NEVER EXPOSED TO
THE PUBLIC INTERNET, NEVER
LEAVES THE AWS NETWORK. IT'S
SECURELY TRANSFERRED THROUGH
YOUR VPC. IT'S ENCRYPTED IN
TRANSIT AND AT REST AND BEDROCK
ENFORCES THE SAME AWS ACCESS
CONTROLS YOU HAVE WITH ANY OF
OUR OTHER SERVICES AS BEDROCK
ALSO SUPPORTS A VARIETY OF
REGULATORY STANDARDS. IT'S HIPAA
ELIGIBLE. IT CAN BE USED IN
COMPLIANCE WITH GDPR. WE'VE
ADDED A BUNCH OF OTHER SECURITY
AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITIES,
INCLUDING INTEGRATIONS WITH
CLOUDWATCH TO TRACK USAGE AND
METRICS. CLOUDTRAIL TO MONITOR
API ACTIVITY AND TROUBLESHOOT
ACTIVITY. AND TODAY BEDROCK IS
SOC COMPLIANT. NOW THIS HELPS A
CUSTOMER ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS
CAN HAVE STRONG CONTROLS AND
POLICIES IN PLACE AND HELPS IT
BE USED IN EVERY BUSINESS. NOW,
BEYOND SECURITY, WE NEED
GENERATIVE AI TO BE DEPLOYED IN
A SAFE, TRUSTWORTHY AND RESPONSE
ABLE FASHION. LIKE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND
THAT'S OUR NORTH STAR FOR THE
CAPABILITIES THAT MAKE GENAI
SUCH A PROMISING TOOL FOR
INNOVATION. ALSO, DO INCREASE
THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE. WE'VE
GOT TO FIND WAYS TO UNLOCK
GENERATIVE AI AI'S FULL
POTENTIAL WHILE MITIGATING THE
RISKS. NOW, DEALING WITH THIS
CHALLENGE IS GOING TO REQUIRE
UNPRECEDENTED COLLABORATION AND
A TRULY MULTI-STAKEHOLDER EFFORT
ACROSS TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES,
POLICY MAKERS, COMMUNITY GROUPS,
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES AND
ACADEMICS. WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATING IN A LOT OF THE
GROUPS THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER
TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES EARLIER
THIS YEAR, I JOINED PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS
LIKE DARIO AS HE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'VE MADE A SERIES OF VOLUNTARY
COMMITMENTS TO PROMOTING THE
SAFE, THE SECURE AND THE
TRANSPARENT DEVELOPMENT OF AI
TECHNOLOGY. AND JUST THIS MONTH,
I JOINED A UK PRIME MINISTER
SUNAK, FOR HIS AI SAFETY SUMMIT
TO DISCUSS NEW APPROACHES,
INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF THEIR
NEW AI SAFETY INSTITUTE. NOW AN
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF
RESPONSIBLE AI IS PROMOTING THE
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOUR
CONSUMERS AND THE APPLICATIONS
THAT ARE SAFE THAT AVOID HARMFUL
OUTPUTS AND THAT STAY WITHIN
YOUR COMPANY'S GUIDELINES. AND
THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO
ACTUALLY PLACE LIMITS ON WHAT
INFORMATION THE MODELS CAN AND
CAN'T RETURN. AND WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD HERE, AND TODAY
WE'RE ANNOUNCING GUARDRAILS FOR
AMAZON BEDROCK. NOW THIS IS A
NEW CAPABILITY THAT HELPS YOU
EASILY SAFEGUARD YOUR GENERATIVE
AI APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR
RESPONSIBLE AI POLICIES TO
CREATE A GUARDRAIL. BEDROCK
PROVIDES CONFIGURATION WIZARD SO
YOU CAN ENTER A NATURAL LANGUAGE
DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPICS THAT
YOU WANT. THE MODEL TO AVOID.
GUARDRAILS CAN BE USED WITH ANY
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS
ACCESSIBLE VIA BEDROCK,
INCLUDING THE CUSTOM MODELS THAT
YOU CREATE THROUGH YOUR OWN FINE
TUNING AND YOU CAN ALSO USE
GUARDRAILS WITH AGENTS. SO NOW
YOU CAN HAVE A CONSISTENT LEVEL
OF PROTECTION ACROSS ALL OF YOUR
GENAI GENAI DEVELOPMENT
ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, A BANK
COULD CONFIGURE AN ONLINE
ASSISTANT TO REFRAIN FROM
PROVIDING INVESTMENT ADVICE OR
TO PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT
. AN E COMMERCE SITE COULD
ENSURE THAT ITS ONLINE ASSISTANT
DOESN'T USE HATE SPEECH OR
INSULTS OR A UTILITY COMPANY
COULD REMOVE PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR PII
FROM A CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL
SUMMARY. SO WE'RE APPROACHING
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF GENERATIVE
AI IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT
WAY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT
IT TAKES TO REINVENT. HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO BUILD WITH THIS
TECHNOLOGY? WE JUST, AS YOU'VE
USED AWS TO REINVENT HOW YOU'VE
BUILT AND INNOVATE IT FOR YEARS
AND ULTIMATELY TO TRANSFORM HOW
YOUR ORGANIZATION OPERATES,
WHETHER YOU'RE MIGRATING
ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS,
BUILDING THE NEXT HOT STARTUP OR
OR DEPLOYING YOUR GENERATIVE AI
STRATEGY. OUR APPROACH REMAINS
THE SAME. UM, CUSTOMER
OBSESSION, INNOVATION AND A LONG
TERM VIEW OF WHAT JOINT SUCCESS
REALLY MEANS. TO TELL US MORE
ABOUT HOW HER COMPANY IS BUILT
ON AWS AND IS NOW REINVENTING
WITH GENERATIVE AI, PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE LIDIA
FONSECA, THE CHIEF DIGITAL AND
TECHNICAL OFFICER OF PFIZER.
THANK EVERYBODY. I'D LIKE TO
START BY ASKING HOW MANY
PATIENTS DO YOU THINK PFIZER
TREATED LAST YEAR? YOU MAY BE
THINKING IN THE MILLIONS, BUT IN
FACT WE TREATED 1.3 BILLION
PATIENTS WITH OUR MEDICINES AND
VACCINES. THAT'S ONE OUT OF SIX
HUMANS ON THE PLANET. A TRULY
HUMBLING, ACCOMPLISHED AGENT.
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE
RECOGNIZED AS AN INNOVATIVE AND
ETHICAL COMPANY LISTED IN
FORTUNE'S WORLD'S MOST ADMIRED
COMPANIES. FORBES WORLD'S BEST
EMPLOYERS, AND TIME MAGAZINE'S
WORLD'S BEST COMPANIES, PFIZER
IS EXPERIENCING AN EXCITING
PERIOD OF INNOVATION AND GROWTH
WITH THE LAUNCH OF 90 MEDICINES
AND VACCINES IN 18 MONTHS. THIS
HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BY US OR ANY
OTHER PHARMA COMPANY. IT IS AN
INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS GOAL AND WE
ARE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 13
ALREADY LAUNCHED DIGITAL DATA
AND AI ARE CRITICAL TO OUR
SUCCESS. AS AND WHAT
DIFFERENTIATES PFIZER IS THAT WE
APPLY THIS ACROSS ALL BUSINESS
UNITS. OUR 36 PLANTS AND THE 149
MARKETS THAT WE SERVE QUICKLY
AND AT SCALE TO BRING MEDICINES
TO PATIENTS FASTER. OUR SUCCESS
TODAY RESTS ON THE GROUNDWORK WE
LAID FOR TECHNOLOGY AND AI TO
FLOURISH. CENTRAL IZING OUR
DATA, CREATE STANDARD PLATFORMS,
CULTIVATING STRONG TALENT AND
BUILDING A SECURE FOUNDATION IN
ALL TO INNOVATE FOR MAXIMUM
IMPACT. WE COULD NOT HAVE
ACHIEVED THIS TREMENDOUS REACH
WITHOUT OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
WITH AWS. SO LET ME SHARE A BIT
ABOUT OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER. IN
2019 PFIZER AND AWS CREATED A
PIONEERING SCIENCE DATA CLOUD
THAT AGGREGATES MULTIMODAL DATA
FROM HUNDREDS OF LABORATORY
INSTRUMENTS, EMPOWERING OUR
SCIENTISTS TO SEARCH ALL
HISTORICAL MOLECULE AND COMPOUND
DATA IN REAL TIME COMPARED TO
WEEKS OR MONTHS IN OUR PRIOR
FRAGMENTED ENVIRONMENT AND THE
SCIENTIFIC DATA CLOUD
ACCELERATES ANALYSIS AND
COMPUTATION OF RESEARCH AND WITH
AI ALGORITHMS THAT HELP US
IDENTIFY AND DESIGN THE MOST
PROMISING NEW MOLECULES IS
BUILDING ON THAT SUCCESS IN
2021. PFIZER EMBARKED ON ONE OF
OUR BOLDEST INITIATIVE IS GOING
FROM 10% OF OUR CORE IN THE TO
CLOUD 80% MOVING IN 12,000
APPLICATIONS AND 8000 SERVERS IN
42 WEEKS. ONE OF THE FASTEST
MIGRATIONS FOR A COMPANY OUR
SIZE. THIS MOVE TO AWS SAVED US
$47 MILLION A YEAR AND HELPED US
EXIT THREE DATA CENTERS,
REDUCING 4700 TONS OF CO2
EMISSIONS OR THE EQUIVALENT
ENERGY USE BY 1000 HOMES IN A
YEAR. BUT VERY IMPORTANT ALI. IT
ENABLED US TO INNOVATE WITH
SPEED AND AT SCALE. FOR EXAMPLE,
WE REDUCED TIME TO SET UP
COMPUTING CAPACITY FROM MONTHS
TO HOURS, SPEEDING UP DATA
GENERATION FOR DRUG SUBMISSIONS
BY. 75. AND WHEN COVID HIT, AWS
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO OFFER
THEIR HELP, SCALING US INTO THE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL
CORES IN THE CLOUD AND
ACCELERATING MANUFACTURING AND
CLINICAL TRIALS. WHEN WE RAN
COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE
ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO
MANUFACTURE OUR COVID VACCINE,
AWS JUMPED IN WITH ADDITIONAL
CPUS FOR US TO MOVE FAST. AND
WHEN WE NEEDED TO SUBMIT DATA TO
THE FDA IN UNDER A DAY,
INCREASED OUR CAPACITY IN
ENABLING PFIZER TO MOVE AT THE
SPEED OF SCIENCE. IN FACT, IT
TOOK JUST 269 DAYS FROM WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED OUR PLANS TO DEVELOP A
COVID 19 VACCINE WITH BIONTECH
TO THE DAY THAT WE RECEIVED THE
FDA'S EMERGENCY USE
AUTHORIZATION ACTION. THIS
NORMALLY TAKES 8 TO 10 YEARS.
THANK YOU. WITH THE WORLD
WAITING, WE NEEDED TO
MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE THE
VACCINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
WE HELD FIRM TO OUR MANTRA
SCIENCE WILL WIN. WELL WHILE
SCIENCE DID WIN AND DIGITAL
HELPED US DO IT FASTER, PFIZER
OUR INDUSTRY LEADING DIGITAL
OPERATIONS CENTER ALLOWED US
COLLEAGUES TO SEE PRODUCTION
STATUS ACROSS PLANTS AND RESOLVE
ISSUES IN REAL TIME, YIELDING A
20% THROUGHPUT INCREASE. OUR
MRNA PREDICTION ALGORITHM
YIELDED 20,000 MORE VACCINE
DOSES PER BATCH. IMAGINE THE
LIVES IMPACT IT. TO GIVE YOU AN
IDEA OF THE SCALE, PRIOR TO
COVID, PFIZER PRODUCED 220
MILLION VACCINE DOSES IN TOTAL
AND SCALED TO 4 BILLION OF
COMMUNITY IN 2022. THIS IS NOW
AT THE HEART OF HOW OUR PLANTS
OPERATE, AND WE'RE APPLYING
THESE INNOVATIONS TO THE TO OUR
OTHER MEDICINES AND VACCINES.
MORE RECENTLY, AWS HELPED US
APPLY AI TO GENERATE ALERTS
ABOUT POTENTIAL SUPPLY CHAIN
DISRUPTIONS, PROMPTING US TO
REROUTE SHIPMENTS TO CONTINUE
DELIVERING MEDICINES TO CLINICAL
TRIAL SITES AHEAD OF HURRICANE
IAN'S LANDFALL. DIGITAL AI MADE
IT POSSIBLE FOR PFIZER TO BRING
MEDICINES TO PATIENTS AROUND THE
GLOBE FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE.
NOW LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S NEXT.
AS YOU HEARD, PFIZER HAS BEEN
HARNESSING AI TO DRIVE
INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY ON A
GLOBAL SCALE. AND MORE RECENTLY,
WE ARE LEVERAGING GENERATIVE AI,
WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO DELIVER
ANNUAL COST SAVINGS OF 750
MILLION TO $1 BILLION IN THE
NEAR TERM. SOME REAL TANGIBLE
VALUE TO USING AWS CLOUD
SERVICES. PFIZER QUICKLY
DEPLOYED FOX OUR INTERNAL
GENERATIVE AI PLATFORM ALLOWING
COLLEAGUES TO ACCESS LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS AVAILABLE IN
AMAZON BEDROCK AND SAGEMAKER AWS
BREADTH OF SERVICES AND THE
VARIETY OF LMS IN BEDROCK MEANS
WE CAN SELECT THE BEST TOOLS FOR
USE CASES IN R&D, MANUFACTURE,
MARKETING AND MORE ENABLING
PFIZER AND AWS TO PROTOTYPE 17
DIFFERENT USE CASES IN A MATTER
OF WEEKS. I IN GENERATIVE AI
WILL HELP US IDENTIFY NEW
ONCOLOGY TARGETS, A PROCESS THAT
IS LARGELY MANUAL TODAY WITH AI,
WE CAN SEARCH AND COLLATE
RELEVANT DATA AND SCIENTIFIC
CONTENT FROM MANY MORE SOURCES
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME AND
ALGORITHMS GENERATE AND VALIDATE
POTENTIAL TARGETS TO IMPROVE OUR
SCIENTIFIC SUCCESS WITH BEDROCK,
WE CAN SCAN THE MARKETPLACE FOR
COMPANIES AND ASSETS AUTOMATING
THE CREATION OF COMPANY PROFILES
TO PRIORITIZE POTENTIAL
ACQUISITION ROLES IN
MANUFACTURING. BEDROCK TAKES THE
OPTIMAL PROCESS PARAMETERS TO
IDENTIFY WHAT WE CALL THE GOLDEN
BATCH AND USES GENERATIVE AI TO
DETECT ANOMALIES AND RECOMMEND
ACTIONS TO OUR OPERATORS IN REAL
TIME. AIMING TO IMPROVE CYCLE
TIME BY 25% AWS IS AGILE CULTURE
ALIGNS WELL WITH PFIZER'S
LIGHTSAIL LEAD WAY OF WORKING.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING ON
OUR LEARNINGS TO UNDERSTAND AND
NOT JUST HOW AI CAN TRANSFORM
OUR DAILY WORK, BUT HOW IT MAY
HELP US DISRUPT THE INDUSTRY.
ORI TO CLOSE, WE'RE EXCITED TO
ACCELERATE OUR BATTLE AGAINST
CANCER. WITH PFIZER'S PROPOSED
ACQUISITION OF CDN, A BIOTECH
FOCUSED ON CANCER THERAPY. AS WE
PLAN TO BRING JENS LEADING EDGE
ANTIBODY DRUG CONJUGATE
TECHNOLOGY TO MORE PATIENTS WITH
CANCER, FASTER. YOU SEE, WE HOPE
TO ACHIEVE WITH CANCER WHAT WE
WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH COVID.
OUR WORK WITH THE AWS WILL HELP
US CONTINUE THIS GREAT MOMENTUM
FUELING OUR AMBITION TO CHANGE A
BILLION LIVES EVERY YEAR, NOT
JUST IN A PANDEMIC YEAR. THANK
YOU, AWS FOR HELPING PFIZER
BRING BREAKTHROUGHS TO PATIENTS
FASTER BECAUSE IN THE BATTLE
AGAINST DISEASE, TIME IS LIFE.
THANK YOU ALL. ONE OUT OF EVERY
SIX PEOPLE ON THE PLANET ARE
IMPACTED BY PFIZER. I MEAN, THAT
IS JUST SO IMPRESSIVE. SO
IMPRESSIVE. LYDIA MEANS SO MUCH
TO US, HONESTLY, THAT YOU'VE
TRUSTED AWS TO. TO HELP DELIVER
ALL THESE CAPABILITIES. THESE
BREAKTHROUGHS THAT ARE CHANGING
PEOPLE'S LIVES. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. AND THANK YOU, ADAM AWS
HAS JUST BEEN AN AMAZING
PARTNER. THANK YOU. WE LOOK
FORWARD TO MORE. THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. SO
ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE
ARE USING AWS FOR AGILITY FOR
SPEED AND FOR THE SCALE THAT
THEY NEED TO DRIVE THEIR
FUTURES. BUT THIS REQUIRES
EMPLOYEES WITH TOP NOTCH CLOUD
SKILLS. AND WE KNOW THAT NOT
ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE THAT CLOUD
EXPERTISE AND THAT THERE'S A
LARGE SKILL GAP THAT'S GOT TO BE
CLOSED. SO GENERATIVE AI IS OF
COURSE, THE NEXT INCREDIBLY
EXCITING NEW OPPORTUNITY. BUT
IT'S ONLY GOING TO ADD TO THAT
GAP. AND SO WE'RE INVESTING TO
HELP PROVIDE THE CLOUD SCALE
SKILLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
NEEDED ACROSS THE WORLD FOR
YEARS TO COME. AWS IS COMMITTED
TO TRAINING 29 MILLION PEOPLE
FOR FREE WITH CLOUD COMPUTING
SKILLS BY THE YEAR 2025. AND
WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 21
MILLION ALREADY TRAINED. AND WE
JUST LAUNCHED WE JUST RECENTLY
LAUNCHED THE AWS CLOUD
INSTITUTE, WHICH IS PROVIDING
DEEP CLOUD EXPERTISE TO HELP
STUDENTS LAUNCH AN ENTIRE CLOUD
CAREER. AND WE'VE ALSO LAUNCHED
100 DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING
AND AI COURSES AND RESOURCES TO
SUPPORT INNOVATION AND JUST OVER
A WEEK AGO, WE ANNOUNCED AI
READY, WHICH IS OUR NEW
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE FREE AI
SKILLS TO ANOTHER 2 MILLION
PEOPLE BY 2025 AND TO HELP
STUDENTS AROUND THE WORLD WITH
TO LEARN THE FOUNDATION SKILLS
AND TO PREPARE FOR A CAREER IN
TECH. WE ACTUALLY CREATED AN AI
AND MACHINE LEARNING SCHOLARSHIP
FUND. LET'S MEET SOME OF THE
RECIPIENT. THIS. MY NAME IS
VANIA GAREWAL. MY NAME IS JOSE
TAPIA. MY NAME IS OLYMPIA
OTIENO. WITHOUT THE AI/ML
SCHOLARSHIP, I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP MY OWN
QUESTIONS. KNOW WHAT TOOLS ARE
AVAILABLE TO SOLVE THEM. THE
NANODEGREE IS DEFINITELY
UNLOCKED. MY INTEREST IN AI
CONSTANTLY TRY TO GO OUT THERE
AND TALK TO GIRLS WHO ARE
CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN
LIFE IN KENYA DUE TO CROP
DISEASE WIZ THE RATES AT WHICH
THE YIELDS HAVE BEEN DROPPING IS
DEVASTATING. SO MY COLLEAGUES
AND I HAVE MADE A MOBILE
APPLICATION WITH AI FARMERS
PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE CROP
DISEASES. THE FACT THAT I WAS
ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM,
I NOW KNOW THAT I AM CAPABLE OF
DOING WELL IN THIS FIELD. I
MEAN, THIS IS WHY WE DO THIS
STUFF, RIGHT? WHAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE
JOSE AND OLYMPIA HERE WITH US
TODAY. SO COME ON, LET'S GIVE
THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THERE
WE GO. TO BOTH OF YOU. I'M SO
PROUD. I'M REALLY PROUD OF WHAT
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE. AND I JUST
REALLY HOPE THAT REINVENT THIS
WEEK IS JUST A GREAT, GREAT
EXPERIENCE FOR YOU. THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR LETTING US SHARE YOUR
STORIES AND FOR EVERYONE
WATCHING, WE WANT TO EMPOWER ALL
OF YOU TO BUILD AND TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF IMPACT. AND WE SEE A
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THAT BY
INFUSING GENERATIVE AI INTO ALL
OF THE SYSTEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE
USING INTO THEIR DAILY LIVES. WE
BELIEVE THAT GENERATIVE AI
SHOULD HELP EVERYONE AT WORK
SEAMLESSLY WITH HELPFUL,
RELEVANT ASSISTANCE. WHETHER OR
NOT, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST THING
ABOUT FOUNDATION MODELS IS RAG
OR ANY OF THE REST. AND THAT
BRINGS US TO THE TOP OF THE
STACK, THE APPLICATIONS THAT YOU
USE THAT ARE POWERED BY
GENERATIVE AI, LEVERAGING
FOUNDATION MODELS. WE BELIEVE
THAT GENERATIVE AI, OF COURSE,
HAS THE POTENTIAL OVER TIME TO
TRANSFORM VIRTUALLY EVERY
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THAT WE
KNOW. IT CAN POUR THROUGH THE
NOOKS AND CRANNIES OF A SYSTEM
AND ACTUALLY HELP YOU FIND DATA
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
EXISTED. AND THEN HELP YOU PUT
IT TO OPTIMAL USE. IT CAN
GENERATE INSIGHTS THAT CAN SAVE
HOURS OF MANUAL WORK AND IT CAN
TAKE PROJECTS THAT WERE SLOGS
AND MAKE THEM A SNAP. NOW, ONE
IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS HOW
GENERATIVE AI CAN MAKE THE TASK
OF WRITING CODE RADICALLY
FASTER. AND SO LAST YEAR WE
RELEASED AMAZON CODEWHISPERER,
WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD GENERATIVE
AI, WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD
APPLICATIONS, I SHOULD SAY,
FASTER AND MORE SECURELY BY
GENERATING CODE SUGGESTIONS IN
NEAR REAL TIME. NOW WITH
CODEWHISPERER DEVELOPERS USE A
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPT AND THEN
RECEIVE ACCURATE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN EVERY POPULAR IDE
. AND FOR 15 OF THE MOST POPULAR
PROGRAMING LANGUAGES, A
CODEWHISPERER GIVES DEVELOPERS A
POWERFUL BOOST FOR GENERAL CODE
EXAMPLES. AND OF COURSE WE MADE
SURE THAT IT'S GREAT FOR
PROVIDING SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS
FOR CODE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
WARNER MUSIC GROUP, THE
BUNDESLIGA AND THE CIGNA GROUP
HAVE EMBRACED CODEWHISPERER TO
ACCELERATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT
CAPABILITIES, AND TATA
CONSULTANCY SERVICES, AWS,
ACCENTURE AND HCLTECH ARE MAKING
CODEWHISPERER AVAILABLE TO TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES EACH.
NOW COHEN IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN
THE ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR
INDUSTRY. THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT CODEWHISPERER IS A GAME
CHANGER FOR THEM AND WE WANT AS
MANY DEVELOPERS AS POSSIBLE TO
REAP THE BENEFITS. AND SO WHAT
WE'VE DONE IS TO MAKE CODE
WHISPERER, TO MAKE THE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN IT FREE, FREE FOR
INDIVIDUAL USE. NOW THE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CODE
WHISPERS ARE GREAT FOR GENERAL
CODING TASKS, BUT GENERAL CODING
SUGGESTIONS CAN ONLY GET YOUR
DEVELOPERS SO FAR. IMAGINE
YOU'VE JUST HIRED A NEW
DEVELOPER FOR EVEN IF THEY ARE
WORLD CLASS, THEY ARE NOT GOING
TO DO THEIR BEST WORK UNTIL THEY
UNDERSTAND YOUR CODE BASE AND
YOUR INTERNAL BEST PRACTICES. AN
AI POWERED CODING TOOLS ARE
SIMILAR. YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT
TOOL, BUT FOR THE KIND OF SPEED
AND RELEVANCY THAT MAKES THE
MOST DIFFERENCE, YOUR SOLUTION
HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF
YOUR CODE AND THE BEST PLACE TO
FIND THAT CONTEXT IS INSIDE OF
YOUR INTERNAL APIS, YOUR
LIBRARIES AND YOUR PACKAGES.
THAT'S WHY A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AGO WE PREVIEWED A CAPABILITY
THAT ALLOWS CODEWHISPERER TO
SECURELY LEARN FROM YOUR
INTERNAL CODE BASE TO PROVIDE
MUCH, MUCH MORE PERTINENT,
CUSTOMIZED AND USEFUL CODE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS. CODEWHISPERER IS
AN EXPERT ON YOUR CODE AND CAN
PROVIDE MUCH MORE TAILORED
SUGGESTIONS. CREATING AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR INTERNAL
SDKS, YOUR APIS, YOUR LANGUAGES
AND YOUR CLASSES. AND OF COURSE
ANY CUSTOMIZATIONS ARE ISOLATE
AND WE NEVER USE CUSTOMERS
CONTENT FROM CODEWHISPERER TO
TRAIN ANY OF OUR UNDERLYING
MODELS. NOW TO UNDERSTAND THE
IMPACT OF THIS KIND OF
CUSTOMIZATION, WE WORKED WITH
PERSISTENT A DIGITAL ENGINEERING
PROVIDER. NOW
THEIR STUDIES SHOWED THAT
DEVELOPERS USING CODEWHISPERER
COMPLETED THEIR TASKS AN
ADDITIONAL 28% FASTER WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS THAN WITHOUT 28.
AND AWS IS THE ONLY MAJOR CLOUD
PROVIDER THAT'S CURRENTLY
AUTHORIZING OFFERING A
CUSTOMIZED CAPABILITY THAT
ANYONE CAN SIGN UP FOR AND USE
TODAY. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT CODEWHISPERER ABOUT
CODEWHISPERER CUSTOMIZATIONS AND
HOW IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU
ACCELERATE YOUR WORK AND
INCREASE YOUR IMPACT. BUT WE'RE
JUST GETTING STARTED AND WE SEE
A LOT MORE POTENTIAL USES WITH
GENERATIVE AI. FOR EXAMPLE,
THINK ABOUT GENERATIVE AI CHAT
APPLICATIONS. SO THESE DAYS IT
SEEMS LIKE JUST ABOUT EVERYONE
IS EXPERIMENTING WITH THEM,
RIGHT? AND WHAT THE EARLY
PROVIDERS IN THIS SPACE HAVE
DONE IS REALLY EXCITING AND IT'S
GENUINELY SUPER USEFUL FOR
CONSUMER OWNERS. BUT IN A LOT OF
WAYS, THESE APPLICATIONS DON'T
REALLY WORK AT WORK. THEY'RE
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR
CAPABILITIES ARE GREAT, BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR COMPANY. THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR DATA, YOUR
CUSTOMERS OR YOUR OPERATIONS.
AND THIS LIMITS HOW HOW USEFUL
THEIR SUGGESTIONS CAN BE. THEY
ALSO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHO
YOU ARE AT WORK. THEY DON'T KNOW
YOUR ROLE, YOUR PREFERENCES,
WHAT INFORMATION YOU USE AND
WHAT YOU DO, AND DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO. SO CRITICALLY. OTHER
PROVIDERS WHO HAVE LAUNCHED
TOOLS, THEY'VE LAUNCHED THEM
WITHOUT DATA PRIVACY AND
SECURITY CAPABILITIES. THE
VIRTUE ALI EVERY ENTERPRISE
REQUIRES. AND SO MANY CIOS
ACTUALLY BANNED THE USE OF A LOT
OF THESE MOST POPULAR CHAT
ASSISTANTS INSIDE THEIR
ORGANIZATIONS. AND THIS HAS BEEN
WELL PUBLICIZED AND JUST ASK ANY
CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY
OFFICER OR CSO AND THEY'LL TELL
YOU YOU CAN'T REALLY BOLT ON
SECURITY AFTER THE FACT. AND
EXPECT IT TO WORK AS WELL. IT'S
MUCH, MUCH BETTER TO BUILD
SECURITY INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL
DESIGN OF THE TECHNOLOGY. SO
WHEN WE SET OUT TO BUILD
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS, WE
KNEW WE HAD TO ADDRESS THESE
GAPS, HAD TO BE BUILT IN FROM
THE VERY START. RIGHT? AND
THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M REALLY
PROUD AND EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
AMAZON MQ A NEW TYPE OF
GENERATIVE AI POWERED ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO WORK FOR YOU AT WORK
. Q LETS YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS
QUICKLY WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE
INTERACTIONS, YOU CAN EASILY
CHAT, GENERATE CONTENT, TAKE
ACTIONS, AND IT'S ALL INFORMED
BY AN UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA REPOSITOR WIZ
YOUR OPERATIONS. AND OF COURSE
WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT ROCK SOLID
SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARE. SO Q
UNDERSTANDS AND RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING IDENTITIES, YOUR ROLES
AND YOUR PERMISSIONS. IF A USER
DOES NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO
ACCESS SOMETHING WITHOUT Q, THEY
CANNOT ACCESS IT WITH Q EITHER.
AND WE'VE DESIGNED Q TO MEET
ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS AND
ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS STRINGENT
REQUIREMENTS FROM DAY ONE. AND
WE NEVER WANT BUSINESS CUSTOMERS
CONTENT. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
USE THAT CONTENT FOR. Q TO TRAIN
UNDERLYING MODELS. I REALLY
BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO BE
TRANSFORMATIVE. WE WANT LOTS OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO DO
LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
TO BENEFIT FROM AMAZON. Q NOW,
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. WE WANT Q
TO HELP DEVELOPERS AND BUILDERS
BE MORE EFFICIENT, MORE
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND MORE
PROFICIENT. SO FOR STARTERS,
AMAZON Q IS YOUR EXPERT
ASSISTANT FOR BUILDING ON AWS
NOW TO SUPERCHARGE WORK FOR
DEVELOPERS AND IT PROS? WE'VE
TRAINED AMAZON Q ON 17 YEARS
WORTH OF KNOWLEDGE SO IT CAN
TRANSFORM THE WAY YOU THINK,
OPTIMIZE AND OPERATE
APPLICATIONS AND WORKLOADS ON
AWS AND WE'VE PUT AMAZON. Q
WHERE YOU WORK, SO IT'S READY TO
ASSIST YOU IN THE AWS MANAGEMENT
CONSOLE AND DOCUMENTATION CHAN
IN YOUR IDP VIA CODEWHISPERER
AND IN YOUR TEAM CHAT ROOMS LIKE
SLACK, YOU CAN CHAT WITH AWS
CLOUD TO EXPLORE AWS
CAPABILITIES, LEARN UNFAMILIAR
TECHNOLOGIES, ARCHITECT
SOLUTIONS. ITS AN EXPERT IN AWS
WELL-ARCHITECTED PATTERNS LEARNS
BEST PRACTICES AND SOLUTION
IMPLEMENTATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK AMAZON Q HOW DO I
BUILD A WEB APPLICATION WITH
AWS? WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? IT'S
GOING TO ANSWER WITH A LIST OF
POTENTIAL SERVICES THAT YOU
COULD USE, SUCH AS AMPLIFY,
LAMBDA OR EC2, AND THEN IT'S
GOING TO OFFER REASONS WHY YOU
MIGHT CONSIDER EACH SERVICE.
FROM THERE YOU CAN FURTHER
NARROW DOWN YOUR OPTIONS THROUGH
NATURAL LANGUAGE, LIKE WHICH OF
THESE WOULD BE PREFERRED? IF MY
APP IS ONLY NEEDS TO RUN FOR A
FEW SECONDS AND ONLY HAS VERY
INFREQUENT TRAFFIC LAMBDA AMAZON
Q IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR
REQUIREMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION
AND IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE YOU
WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ONCE YOU'VE
CHOSEN A SERVICE, YOU CAN ASK
AMAZON. Q HOW DO I GET STARTED?
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU STEP
BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR
CONFIGURING THE SOLUTION PLUS
LINKS TO RELEVANT INFORMATION TO
DOCUMENT STATION AND SO ON. AND
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF
HOW AMAZON Q IS GOING TO HELP
YOU WITH YOUR WORK. FOR EXAMPLE,
IF YOU ENCOUNTER AN ERROR WITH
LAMBDA IN THE CONSOLE, YOU JUST
PRESS THE TROUBLESHOOT ROUTE
WITH AMAZON Q BUTTON, AND Q IS
GOING TO RESEARCH THE ERROR, AND
IT'S GOING TO SUGGEST HOW TO FIX
IT. AMAZON. Q CAN ALSO
TROUBLESHOOT YOUR NETWORK
CONNECTIONS AND IT CAN ANALYZE
YOUR END TO END NETWORK
CONFIGURATION AND HELP RESOLVE
OF CONNECTIVITY ISSUES QUICKLY.
THAT IS A HUGE TIME SAVER. NOW
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU HELP US WITH?
HOW ABOUT CHOOSING THE OPTIMAL
EC2 INSTANCE SO YOU CAN JUST
TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR WORKLOAD AND
GET AN ACCURATE, QUICK AND
ECONOMICAL INSTANCE TYPE
RECOMMENDATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
WHICH EC2 INSTANCE TYPES PROVIDE
THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE FOR
VIDEO ENCODING AND TRANSCODING
WORKLOADS SUPPORTING GAMING USE
CASES AND YOU GET YOUR
RECOMMENDATION. IT'S THAT EASY.
THIS IS ALL VERY COOL AND WE
EXPECT THAT AMAZON Q IS GOING TO
SAVE CUSTOMERS SO MUCH TIME IN
ARCHITECTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
AND OPTIMIZING YOUR WORKLOADS.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL THE Q CAN DO
FOR YOU. AMAZON Q IS ALSO GOING
TO BE IN THE IDP FOR DEVELOPERS.
IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE
CODE IN THE IDE OR YOU NEED TO
DIG IN INTO HOW A SPECIFIC
FUNCTION WORKS, AMAZON, Q AND
CODEWHISPERER IS GOING TO HELP
YOU GET UP TO SPEED BY USING ITS
DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF AWS AND ITS
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR CODE BASES
. SO YOU NEED TO ADD TESTS. JUST
ASK Q AND IT'S GOING TO
AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE THE TEST
FOR YOU. AND THIS IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
DEVELOPERS. BUT WE KNEW WE COULD
DO EVEN MORE TO HELP YOU BUILD
EVEN FASTER. FOR EXAMPLE, THINK
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO
BUILDING A NEW FEATURE. YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENTS.
THINK THROUGH DESIGN, WRITE ALL
THE CODE, ADD TESTS, DOCUMENT
THE CODE AND SO ON, AND A FILE
COULD SPAN HUNDREDS TO EVEN
THOUSANDS OF LINES OF CODE. AND
THIS IS A DAUNTING TASK. IF
YOU'RE USING AMAZON
CODEWHISPERER IT'S GOING TO
GENERATE CHUNKS OF NEW CODE FOR
YOU, WHICH IS A REAL TIME SAVER
THAT STILL LEAVES ALL THE REST.
SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR
AMAZON. Q SPECIFICALLY, Q'S
FEATURE DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY,
WHICH IS GOING TO AUTOMATE THE
MULTI STEP DEVELOPMENT TASK OF
ADDING NEW FEATURES TO YOUR
APPLICATION. SO INSTEAD OF ALL
THAT WORK NOW YOU JUST WRITE A
PROMPT AND Q IS GOING TO USE ITS
EXPERTISE ENRICHED WITH AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR PROJECT
CODE, AND IT'S GOING TO DO ALL
THE HEAVY LIFTING FOR YOU. SO
AMAZON Q WILL CREATE THE DRAFT
PLAN, WHICH YOU CAN THEN
COLLABORATE AND ITERATIVELY
IMPROVE USING NATURAL LANGUAGE
CHAT UNTIL IT'S POLISHED AND
READY TO GO. AND THEN Q REALLY
KICKS INTO GEAR. IT'S GOING TO
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN ACROSS YOUR
FILES IN YOUR APPLICATION. AN
AND YOU REMAIN IN CONTROL USING
YOUR EXPERTISE TO REVIEW CHANGES
AND ENSURE THE VERY BEST
QUALITY. SO THIS IS HOURS OF
WORK THAT Q CAN DO FOR YOU WITH
JUST ONE GOOD PROMPT. AND THIS
FEATURE IS AVAILABLE TODAY IN
AMAZON CODE CATALYST AND WILL
SOON BE FULLY AVAILABLE IN THE
IDE. YOU WILL NOT CURRENTLY FIND
AN AI ASSISTANT FROM ANOTHER
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER THAT CAN DO
THIS FOR YOU TODAY. BUT WE'RE
NOT DONE YET. LET'S KEEP GOING.
WE KNOW THAT DEVELOPERS SPEND A
LOT OF TIME SLOGGING THROUGH THE
MUCK THAT COMES WITH MAINTENANCE
AND UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE AND
UPGRADES. BIG DEAL, RIGHT? SO
TAKE TAKE LANGUAGE VERSION
UPGRADES, FOR EXAMPLE. HOW MANY
OF YOU ARE USING OLDER VERSIONS
OF JAVA? BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO
TAKE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS TO
UPGRADE HANDS? OH YEAH. A LOT OF
THEM. SO MIGRATIONS ARE
INEVITABLY COME WITH A LOT OF
NUANCE AND EDGE CASES. AND SO
YOU END UP SPENDING A TON OF
TIME WRITING AND REWRITING THE
CODE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND
TRYING TO GET IT COMPILE TO
COMPILE AND WORK. AND SOMETIMES
THESE PROGRAMS TAKE SO LONG THAT
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE IN A
MIGRATION INFINITY LOOP. JUST AS
ONE ENDS, THE NEXT BEGINS. AND
IT'S NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE
TEMPTATION TO JUST MAINTAIN
STATUS QUO. BUT DOING THAT MEANS
THAT YOU MISS OUT ON PERFORMANCE
IMPROVEMENTS AND IT MEANS MUCH
WORSE THAT IT CAN ALSO OPEN YOU
UP TO POTENTIAL SECURITY
VULNERABILITIES. AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT INTO AMAZON. Q CODE
TRANSFORMATION, WHICH HELPS YOU
WITH UPGRADES TO TRANSFORM CODE
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME THAT
IT TAKES TODAY. ALL THE
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO ALL A
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO IS ASK YOU
TO PERFORM THE CODE
TRANSFORMATION AND IT HANDLES
THE REST FROM IDENTIFYING AND
UPGRADING AND MANDATORY CODE
PACKAGE DEPOSITORIES AND
FRAMEWORKS TO REPLACING
DEPRECATED CODE AND
INCORPORATING SECURITY BEST
PRACTICES. CUZ EVEN GOING TO RUN
TESTS ON THE UPGRADED
APPLICATION VERSION. SO WE'VE
BEEN USING THIS, THIS
APPLICATION, THIS THIS
CAPABILITY INTERNALLY AND THE
RESULTS ARE STUNNING. SO WITH
AMAZON Q TRANSFORMATION IN A
VERY SMALL TEAM OF AMAZON
DEVELOPERS SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADED
1000 APPLICATIONS FROM JAVA
EIGHT TO JAVA 17 IN JUST TWO
DAYS. NOW I'M GOING TO SAY THAT
AGAIN, 1000 APPLICATION UPGRADES
IN TWO DAYS. THAT'S HOW LONG A
SINGLE APPLICATION UPGRADE USED
TO TAKE. I MEAN, THIS IS MONTHS,
MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS OF
DEVELOPER TIME SAVED A LOT OF
VERY HAPPY PEOPLE AT AMAZON OVER
THIS. I PROMISE YOU. SO TODAY,
AMAZON. Q CAN WORK ITS MAGIC ON
JAVA UPGRADES, BUT SOON YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT TO
HELP MIGRATE YOUR NETWORK LOADS
FROM WINDOWS TO LINUX. AND THERE
ARE A LOT OF APPLICATIONS OUT
THERE STUCK ON WINDOWS BECAUSE
OF THE SHEER EFFORT REQUIRED IN
MAKING THE MIGRATION. AND THIS
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HUGE COST
SAVINGS ON COSTLY LICENSING FEES
ON TOP OF THE INHERENT
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY
BENEFITS. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE
OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION? ALL THE FOLKS IN
MARKETING, FINANCE, HR, PRODUCT
MANAGEMENT AND MORE? THERE'S SO
MUCH INFORMATION SPREAD ACROSS
YOUR ORGANIZATION'S DOCUMENTS,
VASS ALL OF YOUR DATA, ALL OF
YOUR APPLICATIONS, ASIANS AND
PEOPLE IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
ROLES, THEY STRUGGLE EVERY DAY
TO FIND THE INFORMATION THAT
THEY NEED TO AND THEN TRANSFORM
IT INTO MAKING DECISIONS AND
TAKING ACTIONS AND DOING THAT
FAST ENOUGH TO STAY COMPETITIVE,
OF FINDING RELEVANT INFORMATION,
MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS, TAKING
ACTION THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR,
RIGHT? YEP AMAZON. Q IS ALSO
YOUR BUSINESS EXPERT. Q HAS
CONNECTIONS TO OVER 40 POPULAR
ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS, SO EMPLOYEES
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION CAN ASK
COMPLEX QUESTIONS AND GET
DETAILED, ACCURATE, NUANCED
ANSWERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO
THEIR ROLE AT WORK. AND AGAIN,
SECURE IS SECURE AND Q IS SECURE
AND PRIVATE. IT RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING ROLES AND THE
PERMISSIONS THAT ARE GRANTED
UNIQUELY TO EACH USER. WE'RE
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, AND I
ACTUALLY WANTED TO SHOW YOU JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF AMAZON. Q AND
FOR YOUR BUSINESS IN ACTION. SO
TO PUT THROUGH Q PUT Q THROUGH
ITS PACES. PLEASE WELCOME AWS
OWN DR. MATT WOOD TO THE STAGE.
THANKS, ADAM, AND GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE. I'M EXCITED TO GIVE
YOU A FIRST LOOK AT AMAZON. Q A
NEW TYPE OF AI ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO BE AN EXPERT IN YOUR
BUSINESS WITH AMAZON. Q YOU CAN
GET QUICK, ACCURATE, RELEVANT
ANSWERS TO YOUR MOST PRESSING
BUSINESS QUESTIONS, ALL
DELIVERED SECURELY AND
PRIVATELY. GETTING STARTED WITH
Q IS SIMPLE AND TAKES JUST THREE
STEPS. FIRST, YOU CONFIGURE
AMAZON Q BY CONNECTING AND
CUSTOMIZING Q WITH DETAILS OF
YOUR OWN ORGANIZATION. THEN Q
CONNECTS TO EXISTING DATA
SOURCES LIKE S3 SALESFORCE,
MICROSOFT, GOOGLE SLACK AND MORE
SUPPORTING OVER 40 POPULAR
BUSINESS APPLICATIONS AND
SERVICES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.
ONCE CONNECTED AMAZON Q STARTS
INDEXING ALL OF YOUR DATA AND
CONTENT, LEARNING EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR
BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES
UNDERSTANDING THE CORE CONCEPT
PRODUCT NAMES, ORGANIZATION,
STRUCTURE, ALL THE DETAILS THAT
MAKE YOUR BUSINESS UNIQUE, AS
WELL AS INDEXING THE DATA FROM
THESE SOURCES. Q ALSO USES
GENERATIVE AI TO UNDERSTAND AND
CAPTURE THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION
WHICH MAKES YOUR BUSINESS
UNIQUE. THIS ADDITIONAL SEMANTIC
INFORMATION IS CAPTURED AS
VECTOR EMBEDDINGS, ALLOWING Q TO
PROVIDE HIGHLY RELEVANT RESULTS
WHICH ARE TAILORED TO YOUR
SPECIFIC COMPANY AND INDUSTRY.
YOUR DATA REMAINS COMPLETELY
UNDER YOUR CONTROL AT ALL TIMES.
AMAZON Q NEVER SHARES IT
EXTERNALLY OR USES IT TO IMPROVE
ANY OF THE UNDERLYING MODELS,
AND THAT'S IT. SURPRISE. THERE
IS NO STEP THREE. JUST OPEN
AMAZON Q IN YOUR BROWSER AND
AWAY YOU GO WITH A FULLY
CUSTOMIZED, SECURE ASSISTANT WHO
IS AN EXPERT IN YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU COMMUNICATE WITH Q THROUGH
THIS FRIENDLY WEB APPLICATION
DESIGNED FOR EVERYONE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION TO USE. Q KNOWS WHO
YOU ARE AND ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY
AND ROLE. AND BECAUSE Q
UNDERSTANDS YOUR BUSINESS
SEMANTICS, YOU CAN ASK FAR MORE
DETAILED AND NUANCED QUESTIONS
AND GET TAILORED ANSWERS FASTER
THAN EVER BEFORE FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK Q TO ANALYZE WHICH
PRODUCT FEATURES CUSTOMERS ARE
STRUGGLING WITH AND RECOMMEND
WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM AS SOON AS
YOU HIT ENTER. Q GETS TO WORK ON
UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION AND
PREPARING AN ANSWER. Q STARTS BY
CREATING A SET OF INPUT PROMPTS.
AUTOMATIC ALI. Q THEN USES ALL
OF THE BUSINESS CONTEXT
AVAILABLE TO FIND RELEVANT DATA,
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS AND
PICKS THE BEST ONES BEFORE
COMBINING EVERYTHING TOGETHER
INTO A RESPONSE, ALL IN JUST A
FRACTION OF A SECOND, USING THE
POWER OF GENERATIVE AI AMAZON Q
REMAINS FAITHFUL TO YOUR
ORIGINAL SOURCES, CITING THEM IN
LINE SO THAT YOU CAN VALIDATE
THE INFORMATION EASILY. Q'S
EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE MAGICAL, BUT
THERE IS NO MAGICAL BLACK BOX
JUST GIVING YOU ANSWERS. YOU CAN
UPLOAD NEW WORD DOCUMENTS TO
CSVS AND OTHER FILES ON THE FLY.
GO TO Q TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS
RESPONSES, LETTING YOU ASK
QUESTIONS ABOUT AD HOC DATA
WHICH HASN'T YET BEEN ADDED TO
ANY CORPORATE SYSTEM. AND AMAZON
Q WAS BUILT WITH PRIVACY AND
SECURITY IN MIND FROM THE GROUND
UP. SO EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SEEK
INFORMATION TO WHICH WE DON'T
HAVE ACCESS, AMAZON Q RESPECTS
YOUR EXISTING ACCESS CONTROLS
ONLY RETURNING INFORMATION
YOU'RE AUTHORIZED TO SEE. ADMINS
CAN ALSO RESTRICT SENSITIVE
TOPICS FILTERING OUT
INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS AND
ANSWERS WHERE NECESSARY. FINALLY
AMAZON Q CAN TAKE ACTIONS ON
YOUR BEHALF THROUGH A SET OF
CONFIGURABLE PLUGINS? AS AN
EXAMPLE, IF YOU UPDATE, SAY,
YOUR TRAINING PRIORITIES, Q CAN
AUTOMATICALLY CREATE TICKETS IN
JIRA. NOTIFY LEADERS IN SLACK
AND UPDATE DASHBOARDS IN
SERVICENOW. Q ALLOWS YOU TO
INSPECT ACTIONS BEFORE THEY RUN
SO YOU CAN REVIEW THEM AND ADD
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND
AFTER THE ACTION RUNS, Q WILL
LINK TO THE RESULTS FOR
VERIFICATION. SO IN SUMMARY,
AMAZON Q BRINGS AI ASSISTANT
INTO THE BUSINESS WORLD,
PROVIDING SECURE TO RELEVANT AND
ACTIONABLE GUIDANCE TAILORED
ENTIRELY TO YOUR COMPANY. WE
CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO TRY. Q AND
SEE HOW IT WILL HELP YOUR
ORGANIZATION WITH THAT. BACK TO
ADAM. THANKS A LOT. THAT WAS
AWESOME. AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
BUSINESSES. EMPLOYEES ARE GOING
TO LOVE AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS AND DISCOVER
AND SYNTHESIZE NEW INFORMATION
AND LIFT FOLKS OUT OF MONOTONOUS
DRAG OF REPETITIVE TASKS. AND IT
IS GOING TO LOVE HOW ALL OF THIS
COMES WITH RIGOROUS SECURITY AND
PRIVACY. NOW, I KNOW AT LEAST A
FEW OF YOU OUT THERE ARE
WONDERING IF AMAZON Q CAN ACCESS
MY DATA? DOES THAT MEAN IT CAN
HELP WITH MY BUSINESS
INTELLIGENCE? YES. AND OF COURSE
THE ANDREW NG ANSWER IS A
RESOUNDING YES. SO WE'VE BEEN
WORKING FOR A WHILE TO MAKE
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE MORE
ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WITHOUT BI
EXPERTISE. WE THINK ANYONE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS
OF THEIR DATA USING NATURAL
LANGUAGE AND SO AMAZON
QUICKSIGHT OUR ML POWER BI
SERVICE NOW HAS AMAZON Q
FEATURES BUILT IN FIRST AMAZON Q
IS GOING TO HELP REDUCE THE TIME
THAT IT TAKES BUSINESS ANALYSTS
TO CREATE DASHBOARDS AND REPORTS
FROM HOURS DOWN TO MINUTES BY
LETTING THEM SIMPLY TELL AMAZON
Q WHAT THEY WANT TO VISUALIZE.
FOR EXAMPLE, REGIONAL SALES BY
PRODUCT IS A SANKEY DIAGRAM. Q
COMES RIGHT BACK WITH THAT
DIAGRAM. UM, AND YOU CAN ADD IT
TO YOUR DASHBOARD WITH EASE AND
YOU CAN TELL. Q TO FURTHER
REFINE THE VISUAL, SAY YOU WANT
TO CHANGE THE CHART TO A
VERTICAL STACKED BAR CHART BY
MONTH AND COLOR CODED BY REGION.
YOUR WISH IS Q'S COMMAND. WITH
Q, YOU CAN GET BETTER DASHBOARDS
FASTER, BUT EVEN THE BEST
DASHBOARDS DON'T TELL EVERY
ANGLE OF THE STORY. FOR, FOR
EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ASK AMAZON. Q
WHERE DID WE HAVE THE HIGHEST
SALES? AND YOU GET A GET A
RESPONSE CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR
BUSINESS DATA. YOU CAN ASK A
FOLLOW UP QUESTION EVEN AS
LITTLE AS ONE WORD LIKE LONDON.
AND BECAUSE Q MAINTAINS THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR CURRENT
CONVERSATIONS, YOU CAN GET
INSIGHTS FROM YOUR DATA QUICKLY.
ORI NOW ENABLING PEOPLE TO TALK
TO Q AND QUICKSIGHT IS A BIG
STEP FORWARD IN HELPING YOUR
ORGANIZATION BE EVEN MORE DATA
DRIVEN. BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
GETTING HANDS ON WITH DATA. A
LOT OF PEOPLE CONSUME DATA
THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AND
REPORTS, AND SO, SO MUCH OF YOU
DO AT WORK IS TELLING STORIES
WITH DATA. AND AS YOUR BUSINESS
EXPERT, Q IS HERE TO MAKE THAT
EASIER TOO. LET'S SAY YOU WANT
TO CREATE A MONTHLY REPORT ON
YOUR BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA.
YOU CAN ASK YOU TO WRITE A
MONTHLY REPORT ABOUT THE
BUSINESS AND MAKE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT MONTH.
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU
VISUALIZATION OPTIONS. YOU
CHOOSE THE ONES YOU WANT, AND
THEN Q WILL FORMAT THEM. AND IN
SECONDS YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL AND
COMPELLING STORY AND IT'S
COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE. YOU CAN
ACTUALLY ADD MORE CONTEXT TO THE
SECTION BY ASKING YOU TO ADD A
VISUAL OF THE USAGE TREND, AND Q
WILL GENERATE A SHORT SUMMARY.
AND THEN YOU CAN FURTHER TWEAK
IT BY MAKING IT LONGER, SHORTER
OR REFORMATTING IT TO BULLETS.
LET'S MAKE IT LONGER. ONCE WE'RE
HAPPY WITH THE STORY, WE CAN
SECURELY SHARE IT WITH OTHERS.
WITH AMAZON Q AND QUICKSIGHT YOU
NOW HAVE AN EXPERT BI ASSISTANT
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR BUSINESS ANALYSTS AND IT'S
GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR END
USERS TO GET ANSWERS TO AND
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND THESE NEW Q
CAPABILITIES AND QUICKSIGHT ARE
AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW TODAY. NOW,
A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE
TARGETED TO HORIZONTAL USE CASES
OR SPECIFIC LINES OF BUSINESS
AND AWS HAS APPLICATIONS IN
THESE AREAS TOO. SO OUR FIRST
SPECIALIZED LINE OF BUSINESS
SOLUTION WAS AMAZON CONNECT. SO
IT'S BORN IN THE CLOUD AND OF
COURSE, AMAZON CONNECT IS A
SCALABLE COST EFFECTIVE, EASY TO
USE. CONTACT CENTER APPLICATION
THAT'S REINVENTED CUSTOMER
SERVICE GENERATIVE AI THAT KNOWS
YOUR BUSINESS IS GOING TO HAVE
AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON THE
WHOLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
EXPERIENCE ACROSS SO MANY
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. YOUR
CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAMS ARE AT
THE HEART OF YOUR BUSINESSES
DELIVERING INTERACTIONS THAT
PEOPLE REMEMBER FOR GOOD AND FOR
BAD. SO GETTING THIS RIGHT
REALLY MATTERS IS TODAY CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS SPEND A LOT OF
TIME GATHERING INFORMATION FROM
CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR
QUESTIONS AND THEN THEY SPEND
EVEN MORE TIME SEARCHING FOR THE
RIGHT ANSWER. NOW CONNECT HAS
MADE THIS A LOT EASIER ALREADY
WITH MACHINE LEARNING
TRANSCRIPTION ANALYTICS, BUT WE
KNEW WE COULD MAKE IT EVEN
BETTER FOR YOUR AGENTS AND
CERTAINLY FOR THE CUSTOMERS
WAITING ON THE OTHER END OF THE
LINE FOR HELP. ENTER AMAZON Q
AND CONNECT AVAILABLE TODAY AND
THIS IS GOING TO GIVE CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS A MAJOR ASSIST
AGENTS CAN CHAT WITH. Q DIRECTLY
INSIDE OF AMAZON CONNECT TO HELP
THEM RESPOND QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS. LIVE CHAT WITH Q WITH
FAST ANSWERS IS GREAT, BUT WHAT
IF YOU COULD MAKE THE CALL
ITSELF THE PROMPT NOW INSIDE OF
CONNECT? Q IS ACTUALLY THERE ON
THE CALLS ASSISTING WITH
PROPOSED RESPONSES WITH
SUGGESTED ACTIONS, WITH LINKS TO
RELEVANT ARTICLES? NO TYPING
REQUIRED, SO CONTACT CENTERS,
SUPERVISORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
ARE ALSO GOING TO GET A
GENERATIVE AI BOOST CONNECT NOW
AUTOMATICALLY CREATES POST CALL
SUMMARIES THAT SUPERVISORS CAN
USE TO TRACK FOLLOW UP ACTIONS
AND TO UNCOVER AGENT COACHING
OPPORTUNITIES. AND FOR
ADMINISTRATORS, CONNECT CAN SET
UP CHAT BOTS AND INTERACTIVE
VOICE RESPONSES THROUGH SIMPLE
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPTS.
STREAMLINE LEARNING THE PROCESS.
AMAZON Q IS JUST THE FIRST OF
MANY SPECIALIZED INDUSTRY AND
USE CASE SPECIFIC SERVICES THAT
ARE GOING TO SUPERCHARGE AMAZON
Q SO STAY TUNED. AMAZON
CODEBUILD AMAZON Q BUILDER, YOUR
AWS EXPERT, AWS Q BUSINESS, YOUR
BUSINESS EXPERT AT AMAZON, Q AND
QUICKSIGHT YOUR BUSINESS
INTELLIGENCE EXPERT AND AMAZON Q
AND CONNECT YOUR CONTACT CENTER
EXPERT. ALL ENGINEERED TO OFFER
ASSISTANCE THAT REMAINS FAITHFUL
TO THE INFORMATION THAT YOU
CHOOSE TO FEED IT AND WITH THE
BUILT IN SECURITY AND PRIVACY
THAT YOU KNOW AND THAT YOU COUNT
ON FROM AWS THIS IS JUST THE
START OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP
TO REINVENT THE FUTURE OF WORK.
WE CONTINUE TO INNOVATE ACROSS
ALL LAYERS OF THE STACK TO BRING
YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO HARNESS THE
POWER OF GENERATIVE AI FOR YOUR
ORGANIZATION. PERFORMANT, COST
EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A
NEW SECURE PRIME. EASY WAY TO
BUILD AND SCALE POWERFUL NEW
APPLICATIONS WITH FOUNDATIONAL
MODELS GENERATIVE AI
APPLICATIONS AND CAPABILITIES
THAT CAN BE ENRICHED WITH THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR BUSINESS. AND
IT'S ALL ON AWS BUILT WITH OUR
HIGH BAR THAT GIVES YOU BROAD
AND DEEP CAPABILITIES, CHOICE
AND ENTERPRISE READINESS. BUT
IT'S SO EARLY IN THE GAME AND
WE'RE INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
DO TOGETHER. NOW, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING THAT CUSTOMERS ARE
GOING TO NEED FOR ANY OF THIS TO
WORK, AND THAT'S DATA. YOUR
DATA. NO ONE ELSE HAS IT. NO ONE
ELSE CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU CAN
. YOUR DATA IS KEY TO SETTING
YOUR ORGANIZATION APART FROM THE
PACK. AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED,
GENERATIVE AI HAS JUST MADE IT
SO MUCH MORE RELEVANT AND
IMPACTFUL WHEN YOU TAILOR YOUR
DATA. SO LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM A
LONG TIME CUSTOMER ABOUT HOW
THEY'RE USING DATA TO CREATE
FIRST CLASS EXPERIENCES FOR
THEIR CUSTOMERS. SO PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE, STEPHANE
DURACH, VP OF CONNECTED COMPANY
AT BMW.
THANK YOU. HELLO EVERYONE. IT'S
FANTASTIC TO BE HERE. I COULDN'T
AGREE MORE DATA IS KEY. THE
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCT COMPLEXITY IS
STRONGLY INCREASED. KING AND
DEVELOPMENT SPEED IS ESSENTIAL.
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW BMW IS
MASTERING DATA ACCELERATING THE
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND
DELIVERING BEST IN CLASS
EXPERIENCE TO OUR CUSTOMER
ANYWHERE. AND ANYTIME ACROSS THE
ENTIRE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO FROM
BMW TO MINI AND EVEN ROLLS-ROYCE
, BMW IS PROVIDING GAME CHANGING
VEHICLE ENTERTAINMENT AND
EXPERIENCE POWERED BY AWS. WE
OPTIMIZE OUR TECH STACK, IMPROVE
OUR WORKFLOW AND USE DATA BY
LEVERAGING AWS CLOUD TECHNOLOGY.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES.
CLOUD DATA, BMW CENTRAL DATA
LAKE BUILT BY BMW AND AWS HOSTED
DATA FROM OUR CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET AND BY UPLOADING UPHOLDING
THE STRICTEST DATA PRIVACY
STANDARDS ON TOP OF IT, TEAMS
CAN BUILD THEIR APPLICATION AND
MODEL AS WELL AS DEPLOY UPDATES
AND IMPROVEMENTS TOGETHER. WE
ARE EXPLORING INNOVATIVE USE OF
MACHINE LEARNING, INCLUDING
AMAZON SAGEMAKER. THIS AUTOMATED
DRIVING PLATFORM IS BY BMW IS
BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF
DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEM ON
AWS. THIS AUTOMATED DRIVING
PLATFORM IS CAPABLE TO HANDLE
SEVERAL HUNDRED PETABYTE OF DATA
FROM OUR GLOBAL TEST FLEET. WE
ARE ACCELERATE TESTING OUR
DEVELOPMENT, SIMULATING AND
VALIDATION PROCESS DRAMATICALLY
FOR OUR PRODUCT LAUNCH IN 2025
WITH OUR ROUTE OPTIMIZED
CHARGING SERVICES, WE ARE
PROVIDING REAL TIME TRAFFIC
CALCULATION BASED ON DRIVING
STYLE PREFERENCE TRAFFIC OR
AVAILABLE CHARGING STATIONS AND
MANY MORE. WE ALSO USE AMAZON
TECHNOLOGY LIKE ALEXA FOR OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
AND FIRE TV TO CREATE UNIQUE
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, INSIGHT,
THE VEHICLE, OUR CONNECTED
VEHICLE AI PLATFORM IS BUILT ON
AWS AND FORMED THE BACKBONE OF
THE LARGEST CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET WHERE DE FOR SOME MORE
EVEN EYE OPENING STATS, LET'S
DIVE IN. 20 YEARS AGO BMW
INTRODUCED ITS FIRST VEHICLE
CONNECTED VEHICLE AND WE COME
QUITE A LONG WAY SINCE THEN. AND
NOW THE BMW GROUP HAS THE
LARGEST CONNECTED FLEET WITH
MORE THAN 20 MILLION VEHICLES
GLOBALLY OVER THE LAST THREE
YEARS. WE MIGRATED THE CONNECTED
VEHICLE BACKEND TO AWS BY
UTILIZING THE GLOBAL PRESENCE OF
AWS IN MANY REGIONS WORLDWIDE.
WE ARE UPDATE ADDING MORE THAN 6
MILLION VEHICLES OVER THE AIR ON
A REGULAR BASIS. THE THOSE
NUMBERS ARE GROWING CONSTANTLY.
IT REQUIRES TO MANAGE MORE THAN
12 BILLION REQUESTS PER DAY WITH
OVER 1000 DIFFERENT
MICROSERVICES. ULTIMATELY, WE
ARE PROCESSING MORE THAN 110TB
OF DATA TRAFFIC PER DAY WITH A
REMARKABLE RELIABILITY. LOOK AT
THESE NUMBERS. I'M ALWAYS
IMPRESSED, HOWEVER, WITH OUR NEW
PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE. THIS
NUMBER WILL TRIPLE IN THE NEXT
TWO YEARS. LET'S CHANGE
PERSPECTIVE AND TAKE A LOOK AT A
COUPLE OF NUMBERS IN THE
DEVELOPMENT PHASE. MORE THAN
8500 SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
WORLDWIDE CREATE FIRST CLASS
CODE FOR OUR VEHICLE AND
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE BMW SERIES
RUN SEVEN SERIES RUNS ON OVER
500 MILLION LINES OF CODE. OUR
WORLDWIDE DEV OPS TEAMS EXECUTE
MORE THAN 110 SOFTWARE, BUILDS
EVERY DAY BY USING MORE THAN
60,000 VIRTUAL CPUS TO KEEP UP
WITH OUR DEMAND. WE USE AWS
SERVICES TO SCALE UP AND
ACCELERATE DEVELOPMENT WHENEVER
IT IS NECESSARY. LET'S TAKE A
DEEPER LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT.
TRADITIONALLY, BMW'S COMES FROM
A HARDWARE DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
AND EVERY DEVELOPER HAD TO DO
THE DEVELOPMENT WORK ON A
PHYSICAL TEST TRACK. TODAY WE
ARE USING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY
TO STREAMLINE OUR INFOTAINMENT
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE NEW
APPROACH ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE
TEST FUNCTIONALITIES REMOTELY TO
OUR GLOBAL DEVELOPER TEAMS. AN
EXAMPLE IS USING AMAZON EC2 FOR
VIRTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE
CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COLLABORATION.
OUR NEXT STEP IS TO EXTEND THIS
APPROACH TO BUILD A FULLY
VIRTUAL DIGITAL TWIN. NOW LET'S
TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND SOME
EXCITING FEATURES WE CREATED FOR
OUR MINI CUSTOMERS. ON THE
PICTURE, YOU CAN SEE THE MINI
INTERIOR. IT'S OUR WAY TO
EMPHASIZE BRAND TYPICAL DESIGN.
TAKE THE IMPRESSIVE ROUND ALI
DISPLAY IN OUR NEW MINI FAMILY.
AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, OUR SPEECH
IS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE DOMINANT
MODALITY FOR INTERACTING WITH
VEHICLES. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY
INTEGRATING ALEXA VOICE
ASSISTANT. HOWEVER, THIS YEAR WE
ARE RAISING THE BAR. WE WILL USE
ALEXA TECHNOLOGY TO BRING OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL. NOW LET'S
TAKE A SEAT IN THE BACK OF OUR
SEVEN SERIES. ONE OF OUR MOST
EXCITING FEATURE IS THE BMW
THEATER SCREEN. IT'S THE 30 INCH
SCREEN WITH AN EIGHT K
RESOLUTION. IT IS SPECTACULAR,
INTEGRATED IN THE CAR. IT GIVES
YOU A REAL CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE
WITH FIRE TV. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN
SEAMLESSLY ENJOY THEIR FAVORITE
SERIES AND MOVIES. IT'S OUR
STRONG COLLABORATION WITH AWS
AND AMAZON THAT UNLOCKS NEW
POSSIBILITIES, ENABLE US TO
THINK ABOUT THE CAR IN A NEW
DIMENSION. SO ONE LAST THING TO
GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE INTO THE
FUTURE. THIS IS THE BMW NEW
CLASS. THIS WILL LAUNCH IN 2025.
BMW HAS BEEN ALWAYS ON THE
FOREFRONT OF AUTOMOTIVE
INNOVATION. THE NEW CLASS WILL
BE A QUANTUM LEAP IN CUSTOMER
EXPERIENCE. IT WILL TAKE THE
DRIVING EXPERIENCE TO A NEW
LEVEL AS YOU CAN SEE, THE NEW
CLASS INTRODUCED A COMPLETELY
NEW INTERIOR WITH THE BMW
PANORAMIC VISION. WE DEVELOPED A
NEW HEAD UP DISPLAY TO PROJECT
INFORMATION PILLAR TO PILLAR,
AND FOR THE PERFECT DRIVER
ORIENTATION AND USER EXPERIENCE.
ALL OF THIS EMPHASIZES IMPROVE.
BMW IS MASTERING DATA
ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT
PROCESS AND DELIVERING THE BEST
IN CLASS EXPERIENCE TO THE
CUSTOMER ANYWHERE AND ANYTIME
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EXCITING AND
ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT
NOW. AWS AND THE BMW GROUP ARE
WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER TO
SHAPE THIS FUTURE. THANK YOU
ALL. GOODBYE AND I'LL SEE YOU
SOON. FOR AN INCREDIBLE DATA
PLATFORM YOU'VE BUILT AND THE
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE IT'S
CREATING FOR YOUR CONSUMERS.
JUST AMAZING. THANK YOU, STEFAN.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU, AS
ALWAYS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO
AS STEFAN HAS JUST MADE SO
CLEAR, SUCCESS WITH AI AS WELL
AS WITH NEARLY EVERY OTHER
BUSINESS PRIORITY RELIES ON
HAVING A STRONG DATA STRATEGY.
AND ONE QUESTION I HEAR FROM
CUSTOMERS FREQUENTLY IS HOW
SHOULD I THINK ABOUT DATA IN A
GENERATIVE AI WORLD? WELL, THE
ANSWER IS THAT FOR GENERATIVE
AI, YOUR DATA IS YOUR
DIFFERENTIATOR. NOW WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT CUSTOMIZATION THROUGH
BEDROCK CODEWHISPERER
CUSTOMIZATIONS, AMAZON TAILORED
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND EXAMPLES
FROM DELTA AIRLINES AND PFIZER
ALL TAL ADDING CONTEXT TO YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA IS ABSOLUTELY
CRITICAL TO PROVIDING VALUE.
NOW, IN EACH OF THESE EXAMPLES,
ALS, THE DATA USED TO CUSTOMIZE
THE APPLICATION HAS TO BE UP TO
DATE. IT HAD TO BE COMPLETE AND
ACCURATE. IT HAD TO BE
DISCOVERABLE AND IT HAD TO BE
AVAILABLE WHEN YOU NEEDED IT. SO
THE FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING ALL
OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE YOUR
DATA IS IN THE CLOUD. NOW,
GENERATIVE AI IS JUST ONE OF
MANY REASONS THAT YOU WANT THIS.
HAVING EFFECTIVE CLOUD BASED
DATA STRATEGY IS GOING TO
INCREASE YOUR INSIGHT. IT'S
GOING TO REDUCE YOUR COST AND
IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE
INNOVATION. NOW, TO UNDERSTAND
THIS, JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MANY
DIFFERENT ISSUES THERE ARE TO
CONSIDER WHEN TRYING TO MAKE THE
MOST OF YOUR DATA. ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA. IT
COMES FROM DIFFERENT ORIGINS,
AND IT COMES AT VARIOUS SCALES
AND SPEEDS AS DIFFERENT TEAMS
ALL ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION ARE
GOING TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT
DATA IN MANY, MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF WAYS. AND THEN HOW YOU
WANT TO USE THIS DATA IS JUST AS
VARIED. YOUR STORING IT, YOUR
POWERING, YOUR APPLICATIONS,
YOUR ANALYZING IT, YOU'RE
GENERATING PREDICTIONS FROM IT.
THERE'S NO ONE TOOL OR SOLUTION
THAT CAN DO IT ALL UNLESS YOU'RE
WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES LIKE
PERFORMANCE COST OR
CAPABILITIES. BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE THOSE SACRIFICE CHOICES.
SO WHAT YOU NEED IS A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF TOOLS THAT
ACCOUNTS FOR THE SCALE AND THE
VARIETY OF THIS DATA AND THE
MANY, MANY PURPOSES FOR WHICH
YOU WANT TO USE IT. YOU NEED TO
INTEGRATE IT AND COMBINE ALL
THAT DATA THAT'S SPREAD ALL OVER
TO CREATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND PREDICT
WHAT WILL HAPPEN. AND OF COURSE,
YOU NEED GOVERNANCE SO THAT YOU
CAN HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE OF
ACCESS AND CONTROL EVERY STEP OF
THE WAY. YOU NEED IT ALL. IF YOU
MISS EVEN ONE ASPECT, YOUR
ABILITY TO USE THAT DATA IS
SIGNIFICANTLY HOBBLED. SO IN
ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN
STORE, ANALYZE AND PROCESS THE
DATA YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF DATA
SERVICES SO YOU CAN GET THE
PRICE PERFORMANCE, YOU CAN GET
THE SPEED, THE FLEXIBILITY AND
THE CAPABILITIES FOR YOUR USE
CASE. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
BUILT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SET
OF CLOUD DATA SERVICES OUT THERE
. SO TO START, WE HAVE AMAZON S3
AND CUSTOMERS USE S3 TO MAKE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DATA
LAKES WHERE THEY CAN BRING
STRUCTURED DATA TOGETHER WITH
UNSTRUCTURED DATA AND MAKE IT
ALL AVAILABLE FOR ANALYTICS AND
MACHINE LEARNING. WE ALSO OFFER
EIGHT RELATIONAL DATABASES,
INCLUDING AMAZON, AURORA THE
RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICE
THAT'S BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP
FOR THE CLOUD AND IS STILL THE
FASTEST GROWING SERVICE IN AWS
HISTORY. WE ALSO HAVE EIGHT
PURPOSE BUILT DATABASES, NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES, INCLUDING
AMAZON DYNAMODB, WHICH IS USED
BY OVER A MILLION DEVELOPERS
SORRY, A MILLION CUSTOMERS FOR
ITS SERVERLESS SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND PERFORMANCE AT ANY
SCALE. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE
BROADEST AND DEEPEST SET OF
ANALYTICS SERVICES AND THIS
INCLUDES OUR DATA WAREHOUSE
SERVICE, AMAZON REDSHIFT, WHICH
DELIVERS UP TO SIX OR EVEN SEVEN
TIMES BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
DEPENDING ON YOUR WORKLOAD THAN
OTHER CLOUD DATA WAREHOUSES.
WE'VE GOT AMAZON EMR TO EASILY
RUN SPARK AND OTHER BIG DATA
WORKLOADS AND AMAZON OPENSEARCH
SERVICE WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF ACTIVE CUSTOMERS AND HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF CLUSTERS UNDER
MANAGEMENT. AND THAT ALL
PROCESSES TRILLIONS OF REQUESTS
PER MONTH AND MANY, MANY, MANY
MORE ANALYTIC SERVICES. I WON'T
GO THROUGH THEM ALL, BUT YOU
NEED THIS BREADTH AND THIS DEPTH
OF CHOICE SO THAT YOU CAN NEVER
HAVE TO COMPROMISE ON COST, ON
PERFORMANCE OR ON SCALE, AND
INSTEAD YOU CAN CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOL FOR THE JOB. NOW, WE'VE
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT AI AND ML
EXTENSIVELY, SO I'M NOT GOING TO
DWELL ON THAT HERE. BUT YOU NEED
TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOLS TO FEED YOUR AI AND
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'RE
DOING IN YOUR BUSINESS. AND THE
SECOND THING THAT YOU NEED AS
YOU MOVE TO PUT DATA AT THE
CENTER OF YOUR BUSINESS IS TO
BREAK DOWN YOUR DATA SILOS. MOST
PEOPLE HAVE DATA SPREAD OUT ALL
OVER THE ORGANIZATION IN
DATABASES, ANALYTIC TOOLS, SAAS
APPLICATIONS, SPREADSHEETS AND
MORE. AND TO GET THE MOST VALUE
FROM YOUR DATA, YOU NEED TO BE
ABLE TO USE IT ALL. NO MATTER
WHERE IT LIVES. AND TO DO THIS
TODAY, MOST PEOPLE MOVE DATA
AROUND OR TRY TO CONNECT THE
VARIOUS SILOS USING A PROCESS
CALLED ETL OR EXTRACT, TRANSFORM
AND LOAD. YEAH, I SEE SOME OF
YOU FLINCHED WHEN I SAID THAT
BECAUSE YOU KNOW. RIGHT. YOU
KNOW EXACTLY HOW BAD THIS
PROCESS CAN BE. IT IS TEARING
ALL FIRST DEVELOPERS HAVE TO
DESIGN AN ETL PIPELINE
ARCHITECTURE. THEY HAVE TO
DECIDE WHERE TO EXTRACT THE DATA
FROM, AND IT'S OFTEN COMING FROM
MULTIPLE SOURCES. THEN THEY HAVE
TO WRITE CODE TO TRANSFORM THE
DATA AND REMOVE DUPLICATES. THEY
HAVE TO FILTER OUT OUTLIERS,
RETRIEVE MISSING DATA AND
IDENTIFY CORRUPTED DATA. AFTER
ALL THAT, YOU HAVE TO TRANSFORM.
YOU HAVE TO LOAD YOUR TRANSFORM
DATA TO ITS NEW DESTINATION,
WHICH ONCE AGAIN MEANS MORE CODE
TO WRITE. THEN, IF SOMETHING
CHANGES, LIKE A DATA ENGINEER
SWAPPING OUT A DATA TABLE OR
ADDING A NEW FIELD, YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK AGAIN AND UPDATE ALL OF
YOUR CODE ONCE MORE. IT IS
MONOTONOUS, IT IS TEDIOUS AND IT
IS JUST A WHOLE LOT OF UNFUN
WORK, WHICH IS WHY WE INTRODUCED
OUR VISION OF A ZERO ETL FUTURE
FOR AND IN THIS FUTURE YOU CAN
WAVE GOODBYE TO THE BORING,
FRUSTRATING PROCESS OF ETL. YOUR
DATA IS AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTED
FROM THE SOURCE TO THE
DESTINATION. IT'S THAT EASY AND
YOU GET YOUR DATA WHERE YOU NEED
IT WHEN YOU NEED IT. NO MORE
BUILDING AND MANAGING COMPLEX,
BRITTLE PROCESSES AND PIPELINES.
IT'S REALLY EXCITING. BUT IS IT
REAL? WELL, IS IT DOWN PAYMENT?
LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED A FULLY
MANAGED ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
BETWEEN AURORA, MYSQL AND
REDSHIFT. WITHIN SECONDS OF DATA
BEING WRITTEN INTO AURORA, YOU
CAN USE REDSHIFT TO DO NEAR REAL
TIME ANALYTICS AND ON PETABYTES
OF DATA. YOU CAN ENABLE THIS
INTEGRATION WITH JUST A FEW
CLICKS AND ZERO-ETL. IT IS
INCREDIBLY EASY NOW THIS FIRST
ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IS READY,
IS READY DONE. BUT WE'VE WE'VE
WE WANT TO DELIVER SO MUCH MORE.
AND SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TODAY
TO BE ANNOUNCING THREE MORE ZERO
ETL INTEGRATIONS WITH REDSHIFT.
LET'S GET THEM ALL DONE AT ONCE.
AURORA POSTGRES RDS FOR MYSQL
AND DYNAMODB. THESE ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS AND AMAZON REDSHIFT
ARE ALL AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW
WHEN TODAY. SO. SO THAT MAKES.
YEAH. YOU DON'T LIKE THE MUCK,
DO YOU? SO THAT'S FOUR OF OUR
MOST POPULAR RELATIONAL AND NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES TOGETHER
WITH THE DATA WAREHOUSE THAT
GIVES YOU THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITHOUT ANY OF THE
ETL FANTASTIC. BUT REMEMBER,
WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THIS VISION.
SO OF COURSE OUR NEXT QUESTION
WAS, WELL, WHERE ELSE COULD WE
BE REMOVING THE PAIN OF ETL?
NOW, MANY OF YOU NEED TO USE
SEARCH ON YOUR TRANSACTIONAL
DATA TO ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE
OF YOUR APPLICATION. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE AN
E-COMMERCE APPLICATION AND YOU
WANT TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED
RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOUR USER,
YOU USE SIMILARITY SEARCH ON
TRANSACTION DATA. THAT'S GOING
TO BE STORED IN YOUR DATABASE.
SO TO DO THIS CURRENTLY YOU'RE
DESIGNING, YOU'RE BUILDING,
YOU'RE MANAGING COMPLEX DATA
PIPELINE ARCHITECTURES FROM YOUR
DATABASE TO A SEARCH ENGINE. AND
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOU ARE
BUILDING THOSE PIPELINES TO
AMAZON OPENSEARCH SERVICE FOR
ITS POWERFUL SEARCH CAPABILITIES
. I BET YOU CAN TELL WHERE WE'RE
GOING WITH THIS. SO TODAY I'M
REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE UNVEILED
ONE MORE ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IN
DYNAMO. DB ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
WITH OPENSEARCH SERVICE
GENERALLY AVAILABLE TODAY. AND
THIS NEW INTEGRATION MAKES IT SO
EASY TO SEARCH DYNAMODB DATA
WITH OUR OPENSEARCH SERVICE. AND
IT'S JUST THE FIRST OF THESE
DATABASE INTEGRATIONS TO OUR
OPENSEARCH SERVICE THAT'S GOING
TO HELP YOU DO MORE WITH DATA.
SO OUR NEW ZERO-ETL INTEGRATIONS
ARE BRINGING TRANSACTIONAL DATA
AND ANALYTICS TOGETHER FASTER
AND MORE EASILY AND CUSTOMERS
ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE
IDEA OF A ZERO-ETL FUTURE. SO
YOU CAN BE CERTAIN WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP INNOVATING HERE. NOW
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE
TOOLS THAT YOU NEED AND HOW YOU
CAN HAVE DATA WHERE YOU NEED IT
WITHOUT THE PAINFUL ETL BURDEN.
NEXT YOU WANT TO EMPOWER PEOPLE
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION TO USE
YOUR DATA TO ITS FULLEST AND YOU
WANT THEM WALLOWING IN YOUR
DATA, EXPERIMENTING, ASKING
QUESTIONS, SPARKING IDEAS. AND
YOU WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS.
BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM YOUR
DATA IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE, SO
YOU WANT TO GRANT ACCESS ONLY TO
THE RIGHT EMPLOYEES AT THE RIGHT
TIME. YOU NEED TO KEEP IT SAFE
AND SECURE. SO YOU ALSO NEED
CONTROL, YOUR ACCESS CONTROL.
KOHL THESE ARE OPPOSITES, RIGHT?
NO, YOU CAN HAVE IN FACT, YOU
MUST HAVE BOTH AND THE KEY TO
MAKING SURE THAT YOUR DATA IS,
IS SAFE, IS GOVERNED, HAS ACCESS
, IS GOVERNANCE CREATING
VISIBILITY INTO YOUR DATA AND
CONTROLLING WHO CAN ACCESS YOUR
DATA AND WHEN THEY CAN ACCESS IT
WITH ROBUST GOVERNANCE, YOU'RE
GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO
THE DATA THEY NEED AND ONLY THAT
DATA. AND WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT
DATA YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW WHERE IT
IS. YOU HAVE GUARDRAILS AND
TOOLS IN PLACE TO SAFELY UNLOCK
IT. THAT BUILDS CONFIDENCE. AND
THEN PEOPLE WITHIN THE
ORGANIZATION DEVELOP TRUST IN
THE DATA. YOU ACTUALLY EMPOWER
INNOVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION
RATHER THAN STIFLING IT. AND SO
TO HELP YOU WITH GOVERNANCE, WE
DEVELOPED AMAZON DATAZONE DATA
ZONES, A DATA MANAGEMENT SERVICE
THAT HELPS YOU CATALOG,
DISCOVER, SHARE AND GOVERN DATA
ACROSS YOUR ORGANIZATION. WE'RE
GETTING GREAT FEEDBACK FROM LOTS
OF DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
LEADER IN BRAZIL, ITAU. AND
WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE
IMPACT THAT DATA ZONE IS HAVING
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY IN THIS SPACE.
TODAY, DATA ZONE USES MACHINE
LEARNING TO AUTOMATICALLY ADD
METADATA TO YOUR CATALOG, BUT IN
ORDER TO FIND THE RIGHT DATA AT
THE RIGHT TIME, CUSTOMERS STILL
HAVE TO CHOOSE TO ADD BUSINESS
CONTEXT LIKE EXPLAINING THE
DATA'S PURPOSE OR CLARIFYING THE
COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS. AND NOW
THIS HELPS EMPLOYEES FIND THE
DATA THAT THEY NEED. IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
KNOW THE DATA EXISTS, THE
QUESTION OF ACCESS AND CONTROL
BECOMES MOOT. BUT ADDING ALL
THIS DATA IS A METADATA IS
TEDIOUS. IT'S A MANUAL PROCESS.
WELL, NO LONGER. WE'RE MAKING
YOUR CATALOGING EVEN SMARTER.
AND TODAY I'M REALLY PLEASED TO
ANNOUNCE A NEW CAPABILITY THAT
AUTOMATICALLY SUGGESTS BUSINESS
DESCRIPTIONS TO ADD CONTEXT FOR
YOUR DATA SET IN JUST A FEW
CLICKS, CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS
SIMPLY CHOOSE A DATA SET AND
DATAZONE WILL USE GENERATIVE AI
TO CREATE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS
FOR YOUR DATA. USING OUR TRAINED
MODELS. MAKING IT EASIER TO
UNDERSTAND THESE DESCRIPTIONS
CAN BE REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED, OR
EVEN FURTHER CLARIFIED OR EDITED
FOR YOUR EXACT PREFERENCES. DATA
ZONES ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO USE
YOUR DATA. THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE
TIME SAVER IN THIS CAPABILITY IS
GOING TO HELP EMPLOYEES TO FIND
THE RIGHT DATA FOR EVEN FASTER
INSIGHTS. WE'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE TO HELP YOU
USE DATA GOVERNANCE TO SET YOUR
DATA FREE. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
DO IN YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED AN
END TO END DATA STRATEGY THAT
PROVIDES CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE
ENTIRE SPAN OF YOUR DATA NEEDS.
YOU NEED TO EASILY CONNECT DATA
ACROSS SILOS AND YOU NEED YOU
NEED YOUR DATA TO BE GOVERNED TO
BE CONFIDENT THAT THE RIGHT DATA
IS USED IN THE RIGHT WAYS BY
ONLY THE RIGHT PEOPLE. WE'RE
MAKING AWS THE BEST PLACE FOR
ALL OF YOUR DATA NEEDS ACROSS
ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS.
AND WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS AND
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO MAKE DATA,
YOUR DIFFERENTIATOR IN AI AND
ACROSS YOUR BUSINESS, IT'S
AMAZING. WE'VE TALKED A LOT
ABOUT REINVENTION TODAY AND HERE
AT AWS THE MOST IMPORTANT
REINVENTION OF ALL IS YOURS TO
SUPPORT YOU IN ALL THE WAYS THAT
YOU WANT TO ADAPT AND EVOLVE. WE
CONTINUOUSLY CONTINUE TO
CHALLENGE OURSELVES. WE TRY AND
THINK DIFFERENTLY. WE TRY AND
GIVE YOU THE CAPABILITY WIZ THAT
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED, AND EVEN
SOME MAYBE THAT YOU'VE NEVER
IMAGINED. NOW, THIS ISN'T THE
WORK OF A FEW MONTHS OR EVEN A
YEAR, BUT WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT.
WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE AT
AMAZON WE MAKE BOLD BETS. SO
THIRD PARTY SELLING ON AMAZON
PRIME, EVEN AWS ITSELF IS A BIG
BET. I MEAN, IT TOOK A LOT OF
YEARS AND A LOT OF CAPITAL TO
BUILD OUT THE ON DEMAND
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES THAT
SIMPLY BECAME KNOWN AS THE CLOUD
FOR THIS LONG TERM FOCUS IS A
GOOD THING. BEING WILLING TO
THINK DIFFERENTLY AND LONG TERM
IS A GOOD THING. IT'S THE ONLY
PREDICTABLE WAY TO PROFOUNDLY
CHANGE WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR
CUSTOMERS. AWS. NOW THERE'S
ANOTHER BIG BET THAT AMAZON IS
MAKING YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF
PROJECT KUIPER AND YEAH, KUIPER.
KUIPER'S BUILDING A
CONSTELLATION OF THOUSANDS OF
LOW EARTH ORBIT SATELLITES. WHY?
WELL, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE ON EARTH LACK FAST OR
RELIABLE OR EVEN ANY INTERNET
ACCESS. PROJECT KUIPER IS GOING
TO HELP CLOSE THAT DIGITAL
DIGITAL DIVIDE BY DELIVERING
FAST, AFFORDABLE BROADBAND TO A
WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS
OPERATING IN PLACES WITHOUT
RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTIONS.
IN FACT, JUST LAST MONTH, KUIPER
, THE KUIPER TEAM SUCCESSFULLY
LAUNCHED ITS FIRST TWO PROTOSTAR
SATELLITES INTO ORBIT. IT'S JUST
INCREDIBLE THING. I MEAN, THEY
PUT SATELLITES UP THERE. THEY'RE
WORKING FLAWLESSLY. EVERYBODY'S
REALLY HAPPY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED
THERE RIGHT? WOW I MEAN, KUIPER
IS A GLOBAL HIGH SPEED SATELLITE
NETWORK THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE
COVERAGE IN PLACES THAT HAVE
NEVER HAD COVERAGE BEFORE. I
MEAN, IMAGINE THE POWER OF
DELIVERING A REALLY HARD TO
REACH PLACES, THE ABILITY TO
ACCESS THE INTERNET WITH THE
SAME SPEED. THE SAME RELIABILITY
THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED
EVERY DAY. NOW, THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR CONSUMERS IS,
FOR SURE, ENORMOUS. BUT SO ARE
THE BENEFITS TO BUSINESSES AND
GOVERNMENTS. AND THERE ARE ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES LIKE
RENEWABLE ENERGY PROVIDERS THAT
WANT TO ANALYZE IN REAL TIME
DATA FROM OFF SHORE WIND FARMS
OR FIRST RESPONDERS WHO NEED
FAST, RELIABLE CONNECTIONS
DURING NATURAL DISASTERS OR
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LOOKING
FOR CONNECTIVITY, BACKUP IN CASE
OF AN UNPLANNED OUTAGE. KUIPER
IS GOING TO HELP TO MAKE ALL OF
THIS POSSIBLE AND AWS CUSTOMERS
ARE ALREADY PLANNING FOR THE
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS OPENS UP
TO CONNECT TO THEIR FACILITIES,
THEIR SENSORS, THEIR DATA, THEIR
NETWORKS. IT'S GOING TO BE
AMAZING FOR SO MANY CUSTOMERS,
BUT SOME CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
DON'T WANT THEIR DATA RUNNING
OVER THE PUBLIC INTERNET. AND AS
YOU KNOW, SECURITY IS ALWAYS OUR
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. SO TODAY,
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THAT IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, KUIPER IS
ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE ENTERPRISE
READY PRIVATE CONNECTIVITY
SERVICES. AND NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE DATA FROM
VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE OVER PRIVATE
SECURE CONNECTIONS. AND AS YOU
USE USE THESE CONNECTIONS WITH
YOUR DATA, YOU CAN USE IT INSIDE
OF THE AWS CLOUD TO AN EARLY
ADOPTERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
START TESTING IN THE SECOND HALF
OF 2024. SO WE MAKE BIG BETS
LIKE THESE SO THAT CUSTOMERS CAN
DO THINGS THAT THEY COULDN'T
IMAGINE BEFORE. AND YOU COME ON
THIS JOURNEY WITH US BECAUSE
WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THESE
KINDS OF AUDACIOUS LEAPS AND THE
BENEFITS HAVE BEEN ENORMOUS. THE
EXCITING CHALLENGE AHEAD OF ALL
OF US THIS NEXT YEAR IS TO LOOK
CLOSELY AT OUR WORK AND TO
REIMAGINE IT, TO REINVENT IT, TO
DREAM UP EXPERIENCES THAT WERE
PREVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE AND MAKE
THEM REAL. WE ARE SO EXCITED TO
BE YOUR PARTNER IN THIS NEW
WORLD THAT WE'RE BUILDING
TOGETHER, AND I'M THRILLED THAT
WE GET TO EXPLORE IT. ALL THIS
WEEK. THIS MORNING. IT'S BEEN
INCREDIBLE. I WANT TO THANK ALL
OF MY GUESTS ON STAGE TODAY AND
THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WATCHING
AND OF COURSE, THANK YOU TO THE
WHOLE AWS TEAM FOR WORKING SO
HARD TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. NOW,
THE TEAM DOES HAVE ONE MORE
LITTLE SURPRISE UP UP THEIR
COLLECTIVE SLEEVE. SO I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE VERY
BEGINNING I MENTIONED LOUD AND
GUITARS IN IRELAND, BUT WE
ACTUALLY HAVE A LOUD GUITAR HERE
FROM OUR FRIENDS AT LOUDEN AND
WE'VE INVITED A TALENTED
GUITARIST A LONG TIME AWS
FAVORITE ZACH PERSON TO PLAY US
OUT. SO WE HAVE GOT A GREAT
CONFERENCE HERE FOR YOU THIS
WEEK. NOW LET'S GET OUT THERE
AND REINVENT. THANK YOU. NOW
TAKE IT AWAY, ZACH.
PLEASE WELCOME THE CEO OF AWS,
ADAM SELIPSKY.
GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE
12TH ANNUAL REINVENT. I AM SO
HAPPY TO BE HERE WITH MORE THAN
50,000 OF YOU HERE IN LAS VEGAS
AND MORE THAN 300,000 WATCHING
AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR
JOINING. THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU
. NOW, WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THIS
EVENT JUST A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENTLY AND REINVENT REMAINS
ABOVE ALL, A LEARNING
CONFERENCE, A LEARNING EVENT,
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN
AND GROW HERE ARE EVERYWHERE.
WE'VE GOT MORE THAN 2200
SESSIONS, AND YOU CAN CONNECT
WITH AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
PARTNERS IN THE EXPO ALL AROUND.
AND OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY,
MANY OPPORTUNITY WIZ TO CONNECT
WITH FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE AWS
COMMUNITY. SO WE'VE ALSO GOT A
GREAT SLATE OF KEYNOTES FOR YOU.
YESTERDAY, LAST NIGHT, HOPEFULLY
A LOT OF YOU SAW PETER DIVE INTO
ALL OF OUR INNOVATION AROUND
SERVERLESS. AND TOMORROW WE'VE
GOT SWAMI ON AI AND MACHINE
LEARNING AS WELL AS RUBA'S
PARTNER KEYNOTE. AND THEN OF
COURSE, WERNER CAPS OFF THE WEEK
ON THURSDAY. BUT I'M EXTREMELY
EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE IN
STORE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW HERE
TODAY. SO LET'S GET STARTED. SO
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT
REINVENT IS THE SHEER VARIETY OF
THE CUSTOMERS THAT I GET TO
MEET. I MEAN, FOLKS FROM EVERY
INDUSTRY, EVERY REGION, EVERY
USE CASE. AND THERE'S JUST
NOTHING LIKE IT ANYWHERE FOR AN
INNOVATORS ALL OVER THE WORLD
ARE RELYING ON AWS TO DRIVE
THEIR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING
LEADING ENTERPRISES FROM ACROSS
EVERY INDUSTRY, JUST TO NAME A
FEW IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE'RE
WORKING WITH JPMORGAN CHASE.
WE'RE WORKING WITH GOLDMAN
SACHS, NASDAQ, FIDELITY, ALLIANZ
ITYOU, BBVA, HSBC, GE CAPITAL
ONE, S&P GLOBAL NUBANK AND MORE.
IN HEALTH CARE, WE'RE WORKING
WITH PFIZER, GILEAD, MERCK, NOVO
NORDISK ROCHE, MODERNA, ILLUMINA
. MEDTRONIC 3M HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MORE. IN
AUTOMOTIVE, WE'RE WORKING WITH
EVERYBODY FROM BMW TO STELLANTIS
HONDA, TOYOTA, VW GROUP, NISSAN,
HYUNDAI, FORD MOTOR COMPANY,
MERCEDES BENZ, AND OF COURSE,
MORE. SO MANY AMAZING CUSTOMERS
AND PARTNERS AND STILL JUST A
SMATTERING OF THE LEADERS WE'RE
WORKING WITH TO SHAPE THE
FUTURES OF THESE INDUSTRIES. AND
ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
THAT THEY SERVE. ONE CUSTOMER
AND PARTNER. WE'VE BEEN WORKING
CLOSELY WITH FOR A NUMBER OF
YEARS IS SALESFORCE. SO IN 2016,
SALESFORCE CHOSE AWS AS THEIR
PRIMARY CLOUD PROVIDER, AND
TODAY SALESFORCE USES AWS
COMPUTE STORAGE DATA SERVICE AS
MANY OTHERS TO POWER KEY
SERVICES LIKE SALESFORCE, DATA
CLOUD AND MANY OTHERS. AND
YESTERDAY WE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
OUR PARTNERSHIP TO BRING NEW
CAPABILITIES TO OUR MUTUAL
CUSTOMERS. SALESFORCE IS GOING
TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
ITS ALREADY VERY LARGE USE OF
AWS. AWS WILL BE USING MORE
SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGIES AND
WE'RE MAKING IT EASIER FOR
DEVELOPERS TO QUICKLY BUILD AND
DEPLOY GENERATIVE AI
APPLICATIONS. JENS BY BRINGING
TOGETHER AMAZON BEDROCK WITH
SALESFORCE'S EINSTEIN PLATFORM.
WE'RE ALSO HELPING TO UNIFY DATA
MANAGEMENT WITH OUR NEW ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS BETWEEN SALESFORCE
DATA CLOUD AND AWS STORAGE AND
COMPUTE AND DATA SERVICE DATA
AND ANALYTICS SERVICES. SO THE
CUSTOMERS CAN GET EVEN BETTER
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND WE'RE ALSO
BUILDING TIGHTER INTEGRATIONS
BETWEEN SERVICE CLOUD FROM
SALESFORCE AND AMAZON CONNECT.
ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME,
SALESFORCE IS GOING TO BE
PUTTING ITS PRODUCTS ON THE
MARKET PLACE, MAKING IT EVEN
EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO FIND, TO
BUY AND TO MANAGE SALESFORCE
OFFERINGS. SO WITH THIS EXPANDED
PARTNERSHIP AND SALESFORCE
CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO GET NEW,
POWERFUL WAYS TO INNOVATE AND
BUILD APPLICATIONS. BUT IT'S NOT
JUST GLOBAL ENTERPRISE IS THE
MOST PROMISING UP AND COMER ALSO
CONTINUE TO CHOOSE AWS AS WELL.
ACCORDING TO PITCHBOOK, THERE
ARE MORE THAN 1000 UNICORNS OR
STARTUPS WITH OVER $1 BILLION IN
VALUATION, AND THE VAST MAJORITY
OF UNICORNS OVER 80% CHOOSE AWS
LIKE WIZ, A CLOUD SECURITY
COMPANY AND GREAT AWS PARTNER.
WIZ IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST CYBER
SECURITY UNICORN AND FASTEST
SAAS COMPANY. TO REACH A $10
BILLION VALUATION. REALLY
AMAZING OR ULTIMATE GENOMICS,
ONE OF FAST COMPANY'S MOST
INNOVATIVE COMPANIES IN BIOTECH
AND ULTIMO IS REVOLUTIONIZING
DNA SEQUENCING BY REDUCING THE
COST OF SEQUENCING SIX FOLD OR
PLAID PLAIDS. A DATA STARTUP
THAT POWERS FINTECH TOOLS LIKE
VENMO, ACORN AND ROBINHOOD THAT
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE USING TO
MANAGE THEIR FINANCES. CUSTOMERS
OF EVERY SIZE, EVERY INDUSTRY,
ORI, EVERY REGION, ORGANIZATIONS
YOU MIGHT NEVER IMAGINE CHAN
WOULD RELY ON THE CLOUD ARE
INNOVATING ON AWS. I JUST
RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT LOUDEN
GUITARS, A K10 EXPERT GUITAR
MAKER LOCATED IN A TINY VILLAGE
IN IRELAND, AND THEY'RE USING
AWS TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN
ELECTRONIC PASSPORT PROGRAM
THAT'S GOING TO EASE THE PASSAGE
OF THEIR VERY SPECIAL GUITARS
FOR MUSICIANS AS THEY TRAVEL
THROUGH CUSTOMS. I MEAN, ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES. IT'S AMAZING
ENTERPRISE WIZ AND STARTUPS,
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED
BUSINESSES, UNIVERSITIES,
COMMUNITY COLLEGES, GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, NONPROFITS. THE CLOUD
IS FOR ANYONE AND OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE SOLVING BIG PROBLEMS,
SERVING CRITICAL NEEDS AND
DREAMING UP THE WORLD'S NEXT BIG
THING. THEY COUNT ON US TO BE
SECURE, TO BE RELIABLE, TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY, TO DELIGHT
THEIR CUSTOMERS AND ENABLE NEW
WAYS TO GROW THEIR BUSINESSES.
ALL ALL ON AWS. SO WHY IS ALL
THIS HAPPENING? ON AWS, WE ARE
RELENTLESS ABOUT WORKING
BACKWARDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS
NEEDS AND FROM THEIR PAIN
POINTS. AND OF COURSE WE WERE
THE FIRST BY ABOUT 5 TO 7 YEARS
TO HAVE THIS BROADEST AND
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES THAT
WE STILL HAVE TODAY. AND WE'RE
THE MOST SECURE AND THE MOST
RELIABLE, BUT WE ALSO THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS
PROBLEMS AND THEIR POTENTIAL.
AND THIS HAS LED US TO REINVENT
CONTINUOUS ALI, TO PUSH THROUGH
THE BARRIERS OF WHAT PEOPLE
THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. SO YOU CAN
DO THE SAME. REINVENTING IS IN
OUR DNA AND IT CONTINUES TO
DRIVE US EVERY DAY. AFTER ALL,
THIS IS HOW CLOUD COMPUTING CAME
TO BE. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF
OPERATING OPERATING AMAZON.COM.
WE EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND HOW
HARD, HOW EXPENSIVE IT WAS TO
PROVISION AND MANAGE
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW MUCH OF
THE UNDIFFERENTIATED HEAVY
LIFTING THERE WAS THAT
DISTRACTED, REALLY TALENTED
TEAMS FROM REALLY INNOVATING. SO
WE SET OUT TO RETHINK IT.
INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETELY WITH
AWS. SO EVERYONE, EVEN A KID AND
A COLLEGE DORM ROOM, COULD HAVE
ACCESS TO THE SAME POWERFUL
TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO THE
LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED
ORGANIZATIONS. ALL ON DEMAND,
ALL SECURE, ALL RELIABLE AND ALL
COST EFFECTIVE. NOW IF FOLKS GOT
PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AS
THEY MOVED INTO THE CLOUD, SOME
EVEN HOSTED DATA CENTER CLOSING
PARTIES AND POSTED VIDEOS OF
SHUTTING DOWN SERVER ROOMS. IT
WAS REALLY, REALLY FUN. THIS WAS
FUN FOR US. SO WE INVENTED
REINVENTED INFRASTRUC FROM THE
GROUND UP TO OPTIMIZE AWS FOR
SCALE, FOR SECURITY, FOR
RELIABILITY, FROM ROUTERS TO
COOLING SYSTEMS TO NETWORKING
PROTOCOLS. AND BECAUSE WE LOOK
AT THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, OUR
GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE WAS
FUNDAMENTALLY DISTINCT FROM THAT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS. AND
THAT IS STILL TRUE TODAY. FOR
EXAMPLE, THE AWS GLOBAL
INFRASTRUCTURE SPANS 32
GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AROUND THE
WORLD AND WE'VE ANNOUNCED PLANS
FOR FIVE OR SO MORE EACH AND
EVERY REGION CONSISTS OF THREE
OR MORE AVAILABILITY ZONES OR
AZS AND NO OTHER CLOUD PROVIDER
PROVIDES THAT IN EVERY SINGLE
GEOGRAPHIC REGION. AND THIS IS
CRITICAL WITH EACH REGION. THE
AZS ARE PHYSICALLY SEPARATED BY
A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE UP TO 60
MILES OR 100KM. AND THEN THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH REDUNDANT
FIBER NETWORK THAT PROVIDES
SINGLE DIGIT MILLISECOND
LATENCY. NOW EACH AZ IS AT LEAST
ONE FULLY DISCRETE DATA CENTER
WITH ITS OWN REDUNDANT POWER
WATER FOR NETWORKING AND
CONNECTIVITY. SO IF THERE'S A
UTILITY FAILURE, UNEXPECTED
TRAFFIC SPIKE, HUMAN MISTAKE OR
EVEN A NATURAL DISASTER, THE
REGION REMAINS OPERATIONAL AND
SO DO YOUR APPLICATIONS. NOW,
OTHERS WOULD HAVE YOU THINK THAT
ALL CLOUDS ARE THE SAME, BUT
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. I MEAN,
IMAGINE IF YOU HAD A REGION
SUPPORTED BY A SINGLE DATA
CENTER OR IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR
PROVIDER HAD MULTIPLE AZS IN
FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND YOU
WERE RESILIENT. BUT IT TURNED
OUT THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THE
SAME LOCATION. I MEAN, ONE
INCIDENT LIKE A WATER LEAK
FOLLOWED BY A FIRE COULD TAKE
DOWN AN ENTIRE REGION FOR DAYS
DUE. HAVING THE BROADEST AND THE
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES
MATTERS LIKE HAVING THREE TIMES
THE THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF
DATA CENTERS COMPARED TO THE
NEXT LARGEST CLOUD PROVIDER,
WHICH MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN
CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY AND
HAVING 60% MORE SERVICES IN OVER
40% MORE FEATURES THAN THE NEXT
CLOSEST CLOUD PROVIDER. SO YOU
CAN INNOVATE WITHOUT
CONSTRAINTS. WE REINVENT IT SO
THAT YOU CAN REINVENT, TAKE
STORAGE, FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE
CERTAINLY DIDN'T INVENT STORAGE,
BUT WE REINVENTED HOW PEOPLE
CONSUME AND SCALE STORAGE IN THE
CLOUD WITH OUR VERY FIRST CLOUD
SERVICE, AMAZON S3, SIMPLE
STORAGE SERVICE SO BACK IN THE
DAY, STORAGE WAS PRIMARILY DISK
ARRAYS, WHICH COULD TAKE WEEKS
TO PROVISION AND OBVIOUSLY HAD
FINITE CAPACITY. SO S3 PROVIDED
HIGHLY DURABLE, HIGHLY
PERFORMANT OBJECT STORAGE THAT
CUSTOMERS COULD SCALE INSTANTLY
AND NEARLY INFINITELY. AND I
REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT S3 AT OUR
VERY FIRST TRADE SHOW IN 2006,
ON THE DAY THAT IT LAUNCHED, AND
FOLKS HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING
THE COST. I MEAN, IT WAS SO
DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN WHAT
THEY WERE USED TO, BUT WE KEPT
GOING. WE ADDED A WHOLE LOT OF
STORAGE TIERS, INCLUDING S3
GLACIER, DEEP ARCHIVE, WHICH
DELIVERS ARCHIVE STORAGE AT LESS
THAN A 10TH OF A CENT PER
GIGABYTE. BUT WHY SHOULD YOU
HAVE TO EVEN FIGURE OUT WHICH
STORAGE TIER TO USE? SO WE BUILT
S3 INTELLIGENT-TIERING TO
OPTIMIZE STORAGE BY
AUTOMATICALLY MOVING DATA TO THE
MOST EFFECTIVE ACCESS TIER WHEN
ACCESS PATTERNS CHANGE.
INTELLIGENT-TIERING HAS ALREADY
SAVED CUSTOMERS. YOU READY? OVER
$2 BILLION, BUT IT'S JUST
STORAGE, RIGHT? I MEAN, HERE'S
TO THE SAVINGS. BUT STORAGE,
RIGHT? I MEAN, SURELY THIS CAN'T
BE AN AREA THAT'S READY FOR MORE
REINVENTION. WELL, RECENTLY
WE'VE BEEN RETHINKING STORAGE
FOR YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED AND MOST LATENCY
SENSITIVE WORKLOADS, WORKLOADS
THAT NEED HIGH PERFORMANCE
ANALYTICS PROCESSING, LIKE
FINANCIAL TRADING ANALYTICS,
REAL TIME ADVERTISING, FRAUD
DETECTION AND MACHINE LEARNING
TRAINING. NOW THESE WORKLOADS
ACCESS DATA UP TO MILLIONS OF
TIMES IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AND
DO REQUIRE SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. AND SO
TODAY WHAT HAPPENS IS CUSTOMERS
MOVE DATA OFTEN FROM S3 TO
CUSTOM CACHING SOLUTIONS AND
THEN RUN ANALYTICS AT THESE
SPEEDS. BUT MANAGING MULTIPLE
STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURES AND APIS
ADDS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY. SO WE
LOOKED HARD AT WHAT WE COULD DO
TO ADD TO S3 OKAY, ARE YOU READY
FOR THE FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF
THE DAY? OKAY SO TODAY I'M
EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE AMAZON S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE, A NEW S3
STORAGE CLASS PURPOSE BUILT.
PURPOSE BUILT TO OFFER THE
HIGHEST PERFORMANCE AND LOWEST
LATENCY CLOUD OBJECT FOR STORAGE
YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY ACCESSED
DATA. S3 EXPRESS ONE ZONE USES
PURPOSE BUILT HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE TO ACCELERATE DATA
PROCESSING. IT ALSO GIVES YOU
THE OPTION TO ACTUALLY CHOOSE
YOUR AZ FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND
YOU CAN BRING YOUR FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED DATA NEXT TO YOUR HIGH
PERFORMANCE COMPUTE RESOURCE WIZ
TO MINIMIZE LATENCY. SO S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE SUPPORTS
MILLIONS OF REQUESTS PER MINUTE
WITH CONSISTENT SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. THE FASTEST
OBJECT STORAGE IN THE CLOUD AND
UP TO TEN TIMES FASTER THAN S3
STANDARD STORAGE. NOW THE FASTER
DATA PROCESSING LETS YOU SAVE UP
TO 60% ON YOUR COMPUTE COSTS AS
WELL. FOR WORKLOADS THAT REQUIRE
THE HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS
AND THE DATA ACCESS COSTS. ALSO
ARE 50% LOWER THAN S3 STANDARD.
SO YOU CAN RUN THESE WORKLOADS
AT MUCH, MUCH LOWER COST. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, WITH S3 EXPRESS, ONE
ZONE, PINTEREST HAS OBSERVED
OVER TEN TIMES FASTER RIDE
SPEEDS WHILE REDUCED THEIR TOTAL
COST BY 40% FOR ITS MACHINE
LEARNING POWERED VISUAL
INSPIRATION ENGINE. NOW THIS IS
ENABLING THEM TO DO FASTER
EXPERIMENTATION AND
PERSONALIZATION, IMPROVING
EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR USERS. SO
17 YEARS AGO, S3 REINVENTED
STORAGE BY LAUNCHING THE FIRST
CLOUD SERVICE FOR AWS AND WITH
S3 EXPRESS, ONE ZONE, YOU CAN
SEE S3 CONTINUING TO CHANGE HOW
DEVELOPERS USE STORAGE. THE SAME
SIMPLE INTERFACE AND SAME LOW
COST. AND NOW? NOW EVEN FASTER.
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
REINVENTION. GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING. SO WE REALIZED ALMOST
TEN YEARS AGO THAT IF WE WANTED
TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE
ON PRICE PERFORMANCE FOR ALL OF
YOUR WORKLOADS, WE HAD TO
REINVENT GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING FOR THE CLOUD ERA ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO THE SILICON AND
IN 2018, WE BECAME THE FIRST
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER TO DEVELOP
OUR OWN GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTE
PROCESSORS. WHEN WE ANNOUNCED
GRAVITON, OUR SERVER PROCESS OR
CHIP AND CUSTOMERS LOVE THE COST
SAVINGS THAT IT DELIVERED FOR
SCALE OUT WORKLOADS LIKE
MICROSERVICES AND WEB
APPLICATIONS, BUT ASKED FOR MORE
. SO WE BROUGHT YOU GRAVITON2,
WHICH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE SEVEN
FOLD FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF
WORKLOADS AND WE DIDN'T STOP
THERE. OUR CURRENT GENERATION.
GRAVITON THREE DELIVER IS UP TO
25. BETTER COMPUTE PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO GRAVITON2 AND THE
BEST PRICE PERFORMANCE IN EC2.
IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO USES 60%
LESS ENERGY FOR THE SAME LEVEL
OF PERFORMANCE AND THIS IS SO,
SO IMPORTANT TO SO MANY
CUSTOMERS TODAY. AND THAT'S
COMPARED TO COMPARABLE EC2
INSTANCES. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY
IS ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE
IMPORTANT. TODAY. WE'VE GOT OVER
150 GRAVITON BASED INSTANCES
ACROSS THE EC2 PORTFOLIO AND
MORE THAN 50,000 CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING ALL OF THE TOP 100 EC2
CUSTOMERS, USE GRAVITON BASED
INSTANCES TO REALIZE PRICE
PERFORMANCE BENEFITS. FOR
EXAMPLE, SAP, THEY'VE PARTNERED
WITH AWS TO ACTUALLY POWER SAP,
HANA CLOUD WITH GRAVITON AND
WITH GRAVITON. SAP HAS SEEN UP
TO 35% BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
FOR ANALYTICS WORKLOADS AND AIMS
TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT
. THEIR CARBON IMPACT BY AN
ESTIMATED 45. SUPER IMPRESSIVE
OF WE ARE RELENTLESS ABOUT
INNOVATION AND WE CONTINUE TO
PUSH THE ENVELOPE FURTHER. SO
TODAY I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THE LATEST GENERATION OF OUR
GRAVITON PROCESSOR AWS GRAVITON.
FOUR GRAVITON FOUR OR GRAVITON
FOUR IS THE MOST POWERFUL AND
THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT CHIP
THAT WE HAVE EVER BUILT, WITH
50% MORE CORES AND 75% MORE
MEMORY BANDWIDTH THAN GRAVITON.
THREE GRAVITON, FOUR CHIPS ARE
30% FASTER ON AVERAGE THAN
GRAVITON. THREE AND PERFORM EVEN
BETTER FOR CERTAIN WORKLOADS,
LIKE 40% FASTER FOR DATABASE
APPLICATIONS AND 45% FASTER FOR
JAVA APPLICATIONS AS WE WERE THE
FIRST TO DEVELOP AND OFFER OUR
OWN SERVER PROCESSORS, WE'RE NOW
IN OUR FOURTH GENERATION. IN
JUST FIVE YEARS. OTHER CLOUD
PROVIDERS HAVE NOT EVEN
DELIVERED ON THEIR FIRST SERVER
PROCESSORS YET. WE'RE ALSO
ANNOUNCING THE PREVIEW OF OUR
FIRST INSTANCE BASED ON GRAVITON
FOUR RAG INSTANCES AS RAG IS
PART OF OUR MEMORY OPTIMIZED
INSTANCE FAMILY. THEY'RE
DESIGNED TO DELIVER FAST, FAST
PERFORMANCE FOR WORKLOADS. THAT
PROCESS LARGE DATA SETS AND
MEMORY LIKE DATABASES OR REAL
TIME BIG DATA ANALYTICS. RAG
INSTANCES PROVIDE THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY
EFFICIENCY FOR MEMORY INTENSIVE
WORKLOADS AND THERE ARE MANY,
MANY MORE GRAVITON. FOUR
INSTANCES COMING HIGHLY RELIABLE
REGIONS WITH AVAILABILITY ZONES
DURABLE, INSTANTLY SCALABLE, LOW
COST STORAGE, LEADING PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITH CUSTOM DESIGNED
CHIPS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW
EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'RE
REINVENTING TO CONSTANTLY
DELIVER WHAT YOU NEED TO DRIVE
YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE, YOUR
INNOVATION, AND YOUR BUSINESSES.
AND FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES WE
HAVE BEEN SO INTENT ON PROVIDING
YOU WITH THE BROADEST AND
DEEPEST FUNCTIONALITY WITH THE
FAST PACE OF INNOVATION, THE
MOST RELIABLE, THE MOST SECURE
CLOUD SERVICES AND OF COURSE THE
LARGEST AND THE MOST DIVERSE
COMMUNITY OF CUSTOMERS AND
PARTNERS. NOW THESE ADVANTAGES
ARE ALWAYS RELEVANT, BUT NO MORE
SO THAN TODAY, BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALSO THE FOUNDATION FOR
REINVENTING WITH GENERATIVE AI I
NOW HERE TO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
THE BROADEST AND DEEPEST
CAPABILITIES, THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY AND
THE PRIVACY YOU TRUST. YOU NEED
AT ALL. AMAZON HAS BEEN
INNOVATING WITH AI FOR DECADES.
WE USE IT ACROSS THE COMPANY TO
OPTIMIZE THINGS LIKE OUR COMPANY
WIDE SUPPLY CHAIN TO CREATE
BETTER RETAIL SEARCH
CAPABILITIES, WIZ TO DELIVER NEW
EXPERIENCES LIKE AMAZON, ALEXA
OR OUR JUST WALK OUT SHOPPING
TECHNOLOGY. GENAI IS THE NEXT
STEP IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,
AND IT IS GOING TO REINVENT
EVERY APPLICATION THAT WE
INTERACT WITH AT WORK AND AT
HOME. WE'RE READY TO HELP YOU
REINVENT WITH GENERATIVE AI
BECAUSE AGAIN, WE THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES
TO MEET YOUR NEEDS AND WE
REINVENT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND
BECAUSE WE'RE INTIMATELY
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT MEANS TO
REINVENT OURSELVES AS WE
UNDERSTAND HOW TO HELP YOU WITH
YOUR REINVENTIONS. FROM STARTUPS
TO ENTERPRISES, ORGANIZATIONS OF
ALL SIZES ARE GETTING GOING WITH
GENERATIVE AI. THEY WANT TO TAKE
THE MOMENTUM THAT THEY'RE
BUILDING WITH EARLY
EXPERIMENTATION AND TURN IT INTO
REAL WORLD PRODUCTIVITY GAINS
AND INNOVATE, INNOVATE,
INNOVATE. SO WE THINK ABOUT
GENERATIVE AI AS HAVING ACTUALLY
THREE MACRO LAYERS, IF YOU WILL,
OF A STACK. AND THEY'RE ALL
EQUALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE ARE
INVESTING IN ALL THREE OF THEM.
SO THE BOTTOM LAYER IS USED TO
TRAIN FOUNDATION MODELS, OTHER
AND LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, FMS,
WE'LL CALL THEM AND TO RUN THESE
MODELS IN PRODUCTION, THE MIDDLE
LAYER PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE LMS
AND OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
YOU NEED AND ALL THE TOOLS THAT
YOU NEED TO BUILD AND SCALE
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
THEM. AND THEN AT THE TOP LAYER,
WE'VE GOT APPLICATIONS THAT ARE
BUILT USING FMS SO THAT YOU CAN
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GENERATIVE AI
QUICKLY WITHOUT EVEN NEEDING ANY
SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE. SO LET'S
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LAYER
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WITH, WITH,
WITH THE FOUNDATION MODELS,
THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF
WORKLOADS TRAINING AND INFERENCE
AND TRAINING IS TO CREATE AND
PROVE FMS BY LEARNING PATTERNS
FROM LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRAINING,
DATA AND INFERENCE. USE THAT TO
RUN THE MODELS IN PRODUCTION TO
GENERATE AN OUTPUT SUCH AS TEXT
OR IMAGES OR VIDEO. AND THESE
WORKLOADS CONSUME MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF COMPUTE POWER. SO TO
MAKE GENAI GENAI USE CASES
ECONOMICAL AND FEASIBLE, ALL YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR TRAINING, YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR INFERENCE ON
INCREDIBLY PERFORMANT, COST
EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR ML AND AI. NOW
GPUS ARE THE CHIPS THAT CAN
PERFORM A HIGH VOLUME OF
MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS,
SIMULTANEOUS ALI MAKING THEM
POPULAR FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT
WORKLOADS FROM ML SIMULATIONS,
3D RENDERING. AND WE'VE BEEN
COLLABORATING WITH NVIDIA FOR
OVER 13 YEARS TO BRING GPUS TO
THE CLOUD BUILT ON COMPUTE
INSTANCES THAT SUPPORT A WIDE
RANGE OF USE CASES, INCLUDING
GRAPH SIX GAMING HPC, MACHINE
LEARNING, AND NOW OF COURSE
DEMAND AND GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS. IN 2010, AWS WAS THE
FIRST TO BRING NVIDIA GPUS TO
THE CLOUD WITH KG ONE OR THE
CLUSTER GPU INSTANCE. THEN WE
WERE THE FIRST TO OFFER NVIDIA V
100 GPUS WITH OUR P THREE
INSTANCES AND THEN WE WERE AGAIN
THE FIRST TO OFFER THE A 100
TENSOR CORE GPUS WITH OUR P FOUR
INSTANCES IN PRODUCTION AND
EARLIER THIS YEAR, YES, WE WERE
THE FIRST MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER
TO BRING NVIDIA H100 GPUS TO
MARKET WITH OUR P FIVE INSTANCES
AND THE P FIVE ARE PROVIDING
AMAZING PERFORMANCE FOR
TRAINING. THEY'RE UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER AND 40% LESS
EXPENSIVE THAN P FOUR SECONDS.
NOW HAVING THE BEST CHIPS IS
GREAT AND NECESSARY, BUT TO
DELIVER THE NEXT LEVEL OF
PERFORMANCE, YOU NEED MORE THAN
JUST THE BEST GPUS. YOU ALSO
NEED REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE
CLUSTERS OF SERVERS THAT ARE
RUNNING THESE GPUS. OUR GPU
INSTANCES CAN BE DEPLOYED IN EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH UP TO 3200
GIGABITS PER SECOND OF
NETWORKING THROUGH OUR ELASTIC
FABRIC ADAPTER OR EFA. AND THIS
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
20,000 GPUS IN A SINGLE CLUSTER
FOR PROVIDING UP TO 20 EXAFLOPS
OF AGGREGATE COMPUTE COMPUTE
CAPACITY, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO
A SUPERCOMPUTER. AND ALL OF OUR
GPU INSTANCES THAT ARE RELEASED
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS ARE BASED
ON OUR BREAKTHROUGH NITRO
SYSTEM, WHICH REINVENT NOTED
VIRTUALIZATION BY OFFLOADING
STORAGE AND NETWORKING TO
SPECIALIZED CHIPS SO THAT ALL OF
THE SERVICE COMPUTE IS DEDICATED
TO RUNNING YOUR WORKLOADS. AND
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT OTHER
CLOUD PROVIDERS CAN OFFER. AGAIN
NOW WITH NITRO THIS DELIVERS
PERFORMANCE INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM BARE METAL, BUT AT A LOWER
PRICE. AND THE NITRO SYSTEM ALSO
PROVIDES ENHANCED SECURITY THAT
CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS AND
PROTECTS AND VERIFIES THAT THE
INSTANCE HARDWARE AND FIRMWARE
ARE ALL ROBUST. WE'VE WORKED
CLOSELY WITH NVIDIA TO INTEGRATE
OUR NETWORKING AND OUR
VIRTUALIZATION CAPABILITIES WITH
THEIR CHIPS TO BRING OUR GPU
INSTANCES TO CUSTOMERS AND TODAY
I'M THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE
ARE EXPANDING OUR PARTNERSHIP
WITH NVIDIA WITH MORE
INNOVATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO
DELIVER THE MOST ADVANCED
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS WITH, WITH WITH GPUS
AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE JENSEN
HUANG, FOUNDER AND CEO OF NVIDIA
HERE ON STAGE WITH US TO TELL US
MORE. KALLEL JENSEN, SO GOOD TO
SEE YOU. I'M THRILLED TO BE
HERE. YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US TODAY. IT'S
AMAZING. SO AS I'VE JUST
DISCUSSED, WE'VE GOT A LONG
PARTNERSHIP. AWS NVIDIA. I'VE
BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME
TOGETHER AND I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT HOW THE TEAMS ARE
COLLABORATING. YOU AND I WERE
TALKING ABOUT THAT BACKSTAGE.
THE COLLABORATION IS AMAZING.
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LOT OF
YEARS AND I'M JUST THRILLED TO
DEEPEN THE PARTNERSHIP. THANK
YOU. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. I'M
THRILLED TO BE HERE TO CELEBRATE
THE AMAZING WORK OF OUR TWO
TEAMS AND TO HELP ANNOUNCE OUR
BIG NEW PARTNERSHIP. YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR
A VERY LONG TIME. IN FACT, AWS
WAS THE WORLD'S FIRST CLOUD TO
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GPU
ACCELERATED COMPUTING. AND YOU
PUT THE WORLD'S FIRST GPUS IN
THE CLOUD A LONG TIME AGO. AND
SINCE THEN, THIS IS AN AMAZING
STATISTIC. SIX IN THE LAST
SEVERAL YEARS ALONE, JUST FOR
THE AMPERE AND HOPPER GENERATION
WE'VE PUT UP DEPLOYED BOYD TO
MILNE, XEON CPUS IN AWS THAT'S
THREE Z FLOPS. 3000 EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER HOURS MOST YEAH
EXACTLY. YEAH MOST NATIONS WILL
BE HAPPY WITH ONE EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER AND AWS HAS 3000
OF THEM AND WE ARE JUST JUST
GETTING STARTED. I'M DELIGHTED
TO SEE THAT WE ARE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE TODAY A DEPLOYMENT OF A
WHOLE NEW FAMILY OF GPUS, THE L4
, THE L4 IS AND THE BRAND NEW H
200, THE H 200. THIS IS REALLY
AMAZING THING. THE COMBINATION
BETWEEN THE BRAND NEW TENSOR LLM
OPTIMIZING COMPILERS FOR
GENERATIVE AI AND H 200 IMPROVES
THE THROUGHPUT OF IN INFERENCE
LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL INFERENCE
BY A FACTOR OF FOUR REDUCING THE
COST IN JUST ONE YEAR BY A
FACTOR OF FOUR. NOW OUR
COLLABORATION STARTS WITH, OF
COURSE GREAT GPUS AND WE'RE
RAMPING SO INCREDIBLY FAST EACH
QUARTER. WE'RE STANDING UP AND
DEPLOYING MORE THAN ONE SET OF
FLOPS. MORE FOR AN AWS ONE XEN
OF FLOPS MORE EACH QUARTER. IT'S
AN UNBELIEVABLE NUMBER AND ALL
OF THIS IS, OF COURSE, MADE
POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE
ACCELERATED COMPUTING LIBRARIES.
OUR TWO TEAMS STOOD UP A WHOLE
BUNCH OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT
WE'RE ALSO BRINGING OUR MOST
POPULAR LIBRARIES, THE NVIDIA,
AI STACK, OUR NEMO LLM LARGE
LANGUAGE MODEL FRAMEWORK. THE
RETRIEVER FOR INFERENCE MODEL
FOR RAGS, OUR BIO NEMO DIGITAL
BIOLOGY, LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
FOUNDATION MODELS. ISAAC SIM ON
OMNIVERSE FOR ROBOTICS. THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT AMAZON ROBOTICS
USES TO SIMULATE ITS ROBOTS AND
ITS INCREDIBLE WAREHOUSES THAT
YOU GUYS DO. JUST ALL OF THESE
STACKS, SOFTWARE STACKS AND
LIBRARIES WE'RE GOING TO
INTEGRATE INTO AWS. SO OUR TWO
TEAMS HAVE BEEN REALLY, REALLY
BUSY. BUSY INDEED. AND THAT WAS
A LOT OF THAT WAS A LOT OF
ZETAS. AND EVERYTHING. YEAH. SO
AS YOU SAID, THE COLLABORATION
IS GOING TO ENABLE DEVELOPERS TO
ACCESS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY AND
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED IT TO
INNOVATE WITH GENERATIVE AI. NOW
THE ONE OF THE BIG
ANNOUNCEMENTS, OF COURSE, IS
THAT AWS IS GOING TO BE THE
FIRST CLOUD PROVIDER TO BRING
THE LATEST NVIDIA 200
GRACE-HOPPER SUPER CHIPS WITH A
NEW MULTI-NODE NVLINK TO THE
CLOUD FIRST PLACE. AND MAYBE YOU
CAN TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT THAT AND WHAT MAKES THAT
COMPUTING PLATFORM SO POWERFUL
AND HOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER
TO INTRODUCE IT. WELL, WE'RE
BOTH REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT ARM
PROCESSORS AND THE REASON WHY
ARM IS SO INCREDIBLE IS BECAUSE
WE CAN WE CAN MOLD IT TO EXACTLY
THE TYPE OF COMPUTING NEEDS THAT
WE HAVE. IT'S INCREDIBLY LOW
ENERGY. IT'S INCREDIBLY COST
EFFECTIVE. AND SO GRACE-HOPPER,
WHICH IS GX 200, CONNECTS TWO
REVOLUTIONARY PROCESSORS
TOGETHER IN A REALLY UNIQUE WAY.
IT CONNECTS THEM TOGETHER USING
A CHIP TO CHIP INTERCONNECT
CALLED NVLINK AT ONE TERABYTE
BYTES PER SECOND, AND IT'S
CONNECTED IN A COHERENT WAY SO
THAT THE GPU CAN ACCESS ALL OF
THE CPU'S MEMORY. THE CPU CAN
ACCESS ALL OF THE GPU'S MEMORY
AND SO THE TWO OF THESE
PROCESSORS COULD WORK HAND IN
HAND IN A REALLY FAST WAY. THE
SECOND THING THAT WE DID WAS WE
INVENTED A NEW WAY OF EXTENDING
NVLINK TO A VERY LARGE DOMAIN.
SO NOW 32 GRACE HOPPERS COULD BE
CONNECTED BY A BRAND NEW NVLINK
SWITCH, AND THAT BECOMES ONE
UNIT. AND WITH THE NITRO AWS
NITRO THAT BECOMES BASICALLY ONE
GIANT VIRTUAL GPU INSTANCE. I
MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE
THIS. YOU'VE GOT 30 2H2
HUNDREDS. INCREDIBLE HORSEPOWER
IN ONE VIRTUAL INSTANCE BECAUSE
OF AWS NITRO. AND THEN WE
CONNECT IT WITH AWS, EFA YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY FAST NETWORKING ING
ALL OF THESE UNITS NOW CAN
CREATE INTO A ULTRA CLUSTER AND
AWS GLUE CLUSTER. SO I CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE ALL THIS COME
TOGETHER. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE COMBINATION.
I MEAN, HOW CUSTOMERS ARE GOING
TO USE THIS STUFF. ONE CAN ONLY
IMAGINE AND I KNOW THAT THE TH
TWO HUNDREDS ARE REALLY GOING TO
SUPERCHARGE WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE
DOING. IT'S GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE OF COURSE, IN EC2
INSTANCES COMING SOON. NOW IN
THE WORLD OF GENERATIVE AI, A
LOT OF COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO,
UH, TO ONBOARD AI INTO THEIR
BUSINESS AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE
THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT IT
EXTENDS TO THE SOFTWARE, THE
SERVICES AND ALL OF THE OTHER
WORKFLOWS THAT THEY HAVE. SO
THIS LEADS OF COURSE, TO THE
SECOND BIG ANNOUNCEMENT WE HAVE
TODAY. SO PARTNERING NVIDIA TO
BRING THE NVIDIA DGX CLOUD TO
AWS AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE DGX
CLOUD IS IMPORTANT PLATFORM FOR
CUSTOMERS. WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
DGX CLOUD IS NVIDIA'S AI
FACTORY. THIS IS HOW OUR
RESEARCHERS ADVANCE AI. WE USE
AI TO DO NEURAL GRAPHICS. THE
WAY WE DO COMPUTER GRAPHICS
TODAY IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT AI.
WE USE AI TO ADVANCE. WE USE OUR
AI FACTORIES TO ADVANCE OUR
DIGITAL BIOLOGY MODELS, OUR
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS USE IT FOR
ROBOTICS, FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS.
WE USE IT TO SIMULATE EARTH, TO
A DIGITAL TWIN OF THE EARTH, TO
PREDICT WEATHER AND CLIMATE. IT
AND SO THE CLOUD IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO US. WE'RE
INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BUILD THE
LARGEST AI FACTORY NVIDIA HAS
EVER BUILT. WE'RE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE INSIDE OUR COMPANY WE
CALL IT PROJECT CIBA CIBA. YOU
ALL PROBABLY KNOW SINCE YOU'RE
AT A CONFERENCE IS THE LARGEST,
MOST MAGNIFICENT TREE IN THE
AMAZON. WE CALL IT PROJECT CIBA.
CIBA IS GOING TO BE 16,000 AND
16,384 GPUS CONNECTED INTO ONE
GIANT AI SUPERCOMPUTER. FOR THIS
IS UTTERLY INCREDIBLE. WE WILL
BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE TRAINING
TIME OF THE LARGEST LANGUAGE
MODELS. THE NEXT GENERATION
MOISES THESE LARGE EXTREMELY
LARGE MIXTURE MIXTURE OF
EXPERTS, MODELS AND BE ABLE TO
TRAIN IT IN JUST HALF OF THE
TIME, ESSENTIALLY REDUCE THE
COST OF TRAINING IN JUST ONE
YEAR IN HALF. NOW WE'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO TRAIN MUCH, MUCH
LARGER MULTI-MODAL MO MODELS
THIS NEXT GENERATION, LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS, THESE 16,000
GPUS WILL BE 65 EXAFLOPS. IT'S
LIKE 65 EXASCALE SUPERCOMPUTERS
IN ONE. AND SO I CAN'T WAIT FOR
US TO STAND THIS UP. OUR AI
RESEARCHERS ARE CHOMPING AT THE
BIT. NOW, OF COURSE, THIS IS
ALSO A PLACE WHERE WE
COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS AND
CUSTOMERS WHO NEED TO BUILD
CUSTOM AI MODELS. YOU KNOW, IT'S
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO USE OFF THE
SHELF MODELS AND THERE'S BE A
WHOLE BUNCH OF OFF THE SHELF
MODELS IN PUBLIC CLOUDS. IT'S
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN A
SOFTWARE PLATFORM. COMPANIES,
SAAS COMPANIES, FOR EXAMPLE,
SALESFORCE THAT YOU MENTIONED
EARLIER, THEY'LL HAVE ALL KINDS
OF OFF THE SHELF COPILOTS AND
GENERATIVE AI MODELS. BUT A LOT
OF COMPANIES NEED TO BUILD THEIR
OWN PROPRIETARY MODELS. AND SO
WE SET UP THE AI FACTORY. SO
THAT WE COULD PARTNER WITH THEM
TO HELP THEM CREATE THEIR CUSTOM
AIS, AND NOW THEY'LL RUN ALL ON
AWS. WE'LL DEVELOP THE MODEL ON
AWS, COLLABORATE WITH OUR
CUSTOMERS ON AWS, CONNECT THEM
ALL TO YOUR SERVICES AND STORAGE
SERVICES, SECURITY SERVICES AND
ALL KINDS OF OTHER GENERATIVE AI
SERVICES AND THEN DEPLOY IT ALL
IN AWS. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO DO THIS VERY FIRST TIME
IN AWS. IT'S ALL AMAZING. I
MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING
AMAZING THINGS. WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD TO SEE US COME
TOGETHER EVEN MORE TIGHTLY. I
MEAN, IT'S JUST GOING TO BRING
INCREDIBLE BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS
WHO ARE REALLY GOING TO NEED IT.
WE APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION,
APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU AND
LOOK FORWARD TO A LOT MORE OF
THAT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU,
ADAM. THANK YOU. JENSEN. HAVE A
GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. IT'S BEEN
A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. WE REALLY
APPRECIATED IT. NOW LET'S TALK
ABOUT CAPACITY OR ACTUALLY
GETTING ACCESS TO ALL OF THAT
AMAZING COMPUTE. SO CUSTOMERS
WHO WANT TO BUILD AND TRAIN
MODELS OFTEN NEED LARGE AMOUNTS
OF RELIABLE CLUSTERED CAPACITY.
IT HAS TO BE TOGETHER OR IN
CLUSTERS, BUT THEY DON'T
NECESSARILY NEED THE SAME AMOUNT
OF IT ALL THE TIME.
FOR EXAMPLE, CUSTOMERS TRAINING A MODEL. I
MEAN, THEY MIGHT STOP TO
EVALUATE NEWS, USE NEW TRAINING
DATA OR MAKE OTHER CHANGES, AND
THEN THEY WANT TO DO MORE
TRAINING. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS
THAT THEY OFTEN NEED SHORT TERM
CLUSTERED CAPACITY AND IT'S
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NO ONE, NO
CLOUD HAS BEEN ADDRESSING UNTIL
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
FOR ML AND EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
WERE THE FIRST CONSUMPTION MODEL
IN THE INDUSTRY THAT ENABLES ANY
CUSTOMER TO RESERVE THE HIGHLY
SOUGHT AFTER GPU CAPACITY TO RUN
FOR SHORT DURATION MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS. AND THIS
ELIMINATES THE NEED TO HOLD ON
TO THE CAPACITY HOLDING CAPACITY
THAT THEY'RE USING JUST SO THEY
CAN BE CERTAIN THAT THEY CAN USE
IT LATER IF THEY NEED TO USE IT
LATER. NOW EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
ARE DEPLOYED IN ULTRACLUSTERS
INTERCONNECTED WITH OUR EFA
NETWORKING THAT WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THIS MORNING AND THAT
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
HUNDREDS OF GPUS IN A SINGLE
CLUSTER WITH THIS NEW OFFERING.
SO WITH THE CAPACITY BLOCKS,
CUSTOMERS CAN PLAN FOR THEIR ML
WORKLOAD DEPLOYMENTS WITH
CERTAINTY AND THEY KNOW THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE GPU
CAPACITY WHEN THEY NEED IT AND
ONLY WHEN THEY NEED IT. NOW
SUPPORT FOR THE LATEST
GENERATION. HIGH PERFORMANCE
GPUS COMBINED WITH OUR
INNOVATIONS, VIRTUALIZATION,
NETWORKING, CLUSTER MANAGEMENT.
THESE ARE REASONS WHY AWS IS THE
BEST PLACE TO RUN GPUS IN THE
WORLD, BUT TO DRIVE INNOVATION
AND THE BROAD CHOICES THAT OUR
CUSTOMERS WANT IN ML AND AI, WE
REALIZED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT
AGAIN HERE IS ANOTHER PLACE WE'D
HAVE TO INNOVATE ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO THE SILICON, JUST LIKE
WE DID WITH GRAVITON FOR GENERAL
PURPOSE COMPUTING AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT TRAINIUM AND INFERENTIA
. SO TRAINIUM IS OUR PURPOSE
BUILT CHIP FOR TRAINING, MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS, MACHINE
LEARNING MODELS AND INFERENTIA
IS OUR CHIP OPTIMIZED FOR
RUNNING INFERENCE ON THOSE
MODELS? SO EARLIER THIS YEAR WE
ALREADY ANNOUNCED THE SECOND
GENERATION OF OUR INFERENTIA
CHIP INFERENTIA TO AND BECAUSE
WE OPTIMIZE FOR INFERENCE, THE
TWO INSTANCES POWERED BY
INFERENTIA TO ARE OFFER THE BEST
LOWEST COST INFERENCE IN EC2
WHILE ALSO DELIVERING UP TO FOUR
TIMES HIGHER THROUGHPUT AND TEN
TIMES LOWER LATENCY COMPARED TO
THE INF1 INSTANCES. CUSTOMERS
LIKE ADOBE, DEUTSCHE TELEKOM,
LEONARDO, AI, THEY'VE ALL SEEN
GREAT EARLY RESULTS AND THEY ARE
DEPLOYING THEIR GENERATIVE AI AI
MODELS AT SCALE WITH INFERENTIA
TO. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF
INTEREST IN TRAINIUM AS WELL.
OUR TRN1 INSTANCES POWERED BY
TRAINIUM HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED BY A
LOT OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
ANTHROPIC PARTNERS LIKE
DATABRICKS AND RICOH AND OUR OWN
AMAZON SEARCH TEAM USES TRN1
INSTANCES TO TRAIN TRAIN A
LARGE, DEEP, LARGE SCALE, DEEP
LEARNING MODELS. THEY'RE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF A TRAINIUM HIGH
PERFORMANCE SCALE RELIABILITY
AND LOW COST. BUT AS CUSTOMERS
CONTINUE TO TRAIN BIGGER AND
BIGGER MODELS ON LARGER AND
LARGER DATA SETS, WE REALIZED WE
NEEDED TO KEEP PUSHING AND
PUSHING OUR PRICE PERFORMANCE.
WE'RE NEVER DONE THERE. AND
TODAY I'M REALLY EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE AWS TRAINIUM TO OUR
SECOND GENERATION. IT'S OUR
SECOND GENERATION CHIP. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR HIGH
PERFORMANCE TRAINING OF
FOUNDATION MODELS, TRAINING IS
DESIGNED TO DELIVER UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO OUR FIRST GENERATION
CHIPS AND THAT MAKES IT IDEAL
FOR TRAINING FOUNDATION MODELS
WITH HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OR
EVEN TRILLIONS OF PARAMETERS.
TRAINIUM TWO IS GOING TO POWER
THE NEXT GENERATION OF EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND WILL DELIVER
UP TO 65 EXAFLOPS OF AGGREGATE
COMPUTE AND WE EXPECT THE FIRST
TRAINIUM TWO BASED INSTANCES ARE
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR
AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO DO
WITH THEM. MEANWHILE ALL A LOT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS ARE
STILL JUST TALKING ABOUT THEIR
OWN. ML CHIPS. WE'VE ALSO MADE A
LOT OF EXCITING PROGRESS IN
BUILDING THE SOFTWARE TOOLCHAIN
THAT SUPPORTS TRAINIUM IN
INFERENTIA. SO AWS NEURON IS OUR
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT THAT
HELPS CUSTOMERS GET MAXIMUM
PERFORMANCE FROM ML CHIPS. NEW
RON SUPPORTS MACHINE LEARNING
FRAMEWORKS LIKE TENSORFLOW
PYTORCH WITH JAX SUPPORT COMING
REALLY SOON AND SO CUSTOMERS CAN
USE THEIR EXISTING KNOWLEDGE TO
BUILD TRAINING AND INFERENCE
PIPELINES WITH JUST A FEW LINES
OF CODE AND NEURON SUPPORTS THE
MOST POPULAR MODELS, INCLUDING
93 OF THE TOP 100 AND COUNTING.
IMPORTANTLY, YOU ALSO NEED THE
RIGHT TOOLS TO HELP TRAIN AND
DEPLOY YOUR MODELS AND THIS IS
WHY WE HAVE AMAZON SAGEMAKER OUR
MANAGED SERVICE. THAT MAKES IT
EASY FOR DEVELOPERS TO TRAIN,
TUNE, BUILD, MANAGE MACHINE
LEARNING AND FOUNDATION MODELS.
IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE WE
LAUNCHED SAGEMAKER, WE'VE
INTRODUCED A LOT OF POWERFUL
INNOVATIONS LIKE AUTOML MODEL
TUNING, DISTRIBUTED TRAINING,
FLEXIBLE MODEL DEPLOYMENT TOOLS
FOR ML OPS AND BUILT IN FEATURES
LIKE RESPONSIBLE AI. SAGEMAKER
HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN
DEMOCRATIZING ML FOR TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING STABILITY AI AI21LABS
LABS, THOMSON REUTERS,
ASTRAZENECA, 3M, HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AWS,
FERRARI AND MORE, AND SAGEMAKER
CAN TRAIN MODELS WITH UP TO
BILLIONS OF PARAMETERS FOR
EXAMPLE, TI HAS TRAINED 180
BILLION PARAMETER FALCON FM,
WHICH IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MODEL ON
SAGEMAKER USING 3000 GPUS AND
PETABYTES OF PETABYTES OF DATA
STORED IN S3. AND YOU CAN ALSO
DEPLOY THIS TOP RANKED MODEL
USING SAGEMAKER. WE'VE ALSO BEEN
WORKING CLOSELY WITH HUGGINGFACE
TO SUPPORT THEIR MODELS ON
SAGEMAKER AND HAVE COLLABORATED
TO CREATE THE HUGGING FACE DEEP
LEARNING CONTAINERS TO HELP
ACCELERATE TRAINING AND
DEPLOYMENT OF FMS USING
SAGEMAKER, TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA. SO IF YOU'RE
BUILDING YOUR OWN MODELS. AWS IS
RELENTLESSLY FOCUSED ON
EVERYTHING YOU NEED THE BEST
CHIPS, THE MOST ADVANCED
VIRTUALIZATION, POWERFUL
PETABYTE SCALE NETWORKING
CAPABILITIES, HYPER SCALE
CLUSTERING AND THE RIGHT TOOLS
TO HELP YOU BUILD. BUT OF
COURSE, AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF
ORGANIZATIONS JUST WANT TO BE
ABLE TO ACCESS THE MOST POWERFUL
MODELS OUT THERE. THEY WANT TO
GET STARTED QUICKLY,
EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT FMS
AND TESTING DIFFERENT USE CASES
AND TO MEET THE ENORMOUS
OPPORTUNITY HEAD ON. BUT THEY
ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH
MODEL SHOULD I EVEN USE AND HOW
DO I DECIDE WHICH ARE BEST FOR
MY APPLICATION? TITAN HOW CAN I
MOVE QUICKLY TO BUILD AND DEPLOY
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS? JENS
AND HOW CAN I KEEP MY DATA
SECURE AND PRIVATE? THAT'S WHY
WE'RE INVESTING IN THAT MIDDLE
LAYER OF THE STACK. SO NOW WE
KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU NEED IT TO
BE EASIER TO ACCESS A POWERFUL
AND DIVERSE SET OF MODELS. LMS
OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS, AND
THEN TO QUICKLY BUILD
APPLICATIONS WITH THEM ALL THE
TIME, MAINTAINING YOUR SECURITY
AND PRIVACY AND THAT'S WHY WE
BUILT AMAZON BEDROCK SO BEDROCK
IS THE EASIEST WAY TO BUILD AND
SCALE GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS
FOR LMS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS AND CUSTOMERS IN EVERY
INDUSTRY ARE ALREADY USING
BEDROCK TO REINVENT THEIR USER
EXPERIENCES, THEIR PRODUCTS AND
THEIR PROCESSES, AND TO BRING AI
INTO THE HEART OF THEIR
BUSINESSES. SO WHY BEDROCK? SO
FIRST, YOU ENJOY THE BROADEST
CHOICE OF MODELS, MANY OF WHICH
ARE AVAILABLE FIRST OR IN SOME
CASES ONLY ON BEDROCK YOU CAN
ADD YOUR OWN BUSINESS CONTEXT
QUICKLY, EASILY AND PRIVATELY
WITH THE BROADEST SELECTION OF
CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS AND YOU
GET ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
AND PRIVACY. BECAUSE WE DESIGNED
IT THAT WAY FROM DAY ONE. AND
THE CUSTOMER EXCITEMENT HAS BEEN
OVERWHELMING. WE MADE THE
SERVICE GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN
SEPTEMBER AND NOW OVER 10,000
CUSTOMERS ARE USING BEDROCK
AROUND THE WORLD ACROSS
VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY, ADIDAS
HAS ENABLING DEVELOPERS TO GET
QUICK, ACCURATE ANSWERS TO DEEP
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, AS CARRIER
IS USING BEDROCK TO COMBINE
HISTORICAL ACTIONS, PREDICTIVE
ANALYTICS SYSTEMS, ALERTS AND
DATA TRENDS TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THESE ARE
HELPING CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR
ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CUT
CARBON EMISSIONS. NASDAQ IS
USING BEDROCK TO AUTOMATE
INVESTIGATIVE WORKFLOWS ON
SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS AND TO
STRENGTHEN THEIR ANTI ANTI
FINANCIAL CRIME AND SURVEILLANCE
CAPABILITIES. SO MANY MORE,
INCLUDING BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES, CLARIANT COX
AUTOMOTIVE, GODADDY. LEXISNEXIS.
MERCK OMNICOM GROUP ARE ALL
USING BEDROCK. THEY'RE ALL USING
IT TO BUILD GENAI APPLICATIONS.
TODAY BUT IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS.
EVERY ONE IS MOVING FAST,
EXPERIMENTING AND LEARNING. AND
AT THE SAME TIME, THE GENERATIVE
AI TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IS EVOLVING
QUICKLY WITH NEW DEVELOPMENTS
PRACTICALLY EVERY DAY AND
CUSTOMERS ARE FINDING THAT
DIFFERENT MODELS ACTUALLY WORK
BETTER FOR DIFFERENT USE CASES
OR ON DIFFERENT SETS OF DATA.
SOME MODELS ARE GREAT FOR
SUMMARIZATION, OTHERS ARE GOOD
FOR REASONING AND INTEGRATION,
AND STILL OTHERS HAVE AWESOME
LANGUAGE SUPPORT. AND THEN
THERE'S IMAGE GENERATION IN
SEARCH USE CASES AND MORE, ALL
COMING FROM BOTH PROPRIETARY
MODELS AND MODELS THAT ARE
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY.
I MEAN, THINGS ARE MOVING SO
FAST AND IN THAT TYPE OF
ENVIRONMENT THAT THE ABILITY TO
ADAPT IS THE MOST VALUABLE
CAPABILITY THAT YOU CAN HAVE.
THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE
MODEL TO RULE THEM ALL, AND
THERE'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE ONE COMPANY PROVIDING THE
MODELS THAT EVERYBODY USES. SO
YOU DON'T WANT A CLOUD PROVIDER
WHO'S BEHOLDEN PRIMARILY TO ONE
MODEL PROVIDER. YOU NEED TO BE
TRYING OUT DIFFERENT MODELS. YOU
NEED TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH
BETWEEN THEM RAPIDLY OR EVEN
COMBINING THEM WITH THE SAME USE
CASES. AND YOU NEED A REAL
CHOICE OF MODEL PROVIDERS AS YOU
DECIDE WHO'S GOT THE BEST
TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO WHO HAS THE
DEPENDABILITY THAT YOU NEED IN A
BUSINESS PARTNER. I THINK THE
EVENTS OF THE PAST TEN DAYS HAVE
MADE THAT VERY CLEAR. WE'VE BEEN
CONSISTENT ABOUT THIS NEED FOR
CHOICE FOR THE WHOLE HISTORY OF
AWS, AND THAT'S THE APPROACH
THAT WE CLEARLY LAID OUT WHEN WE
STARTED TALKING ABOUT OUR
GENERATIVE AI STRATEGY ALMOST A
YEAR AGO. AND THAT'S WHY WE
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE, TO MAKE
BUILDING AND MOVING BETWEEN A
RANGE OF FOUNDATION MODELS AS
EASY AS AN API CALL. TODAY
BEDROCK PROVIDES ACCESS TO A
WIDE RANGE OF MODELS FROM
LEADERS LIKE I. 21 ANTHROPIC
COHERE STABILITY AI, AS WELL AS
AMAZON'S OWN AMAZON TITAN MODELS
. BUT WE DIDN'T STOP THERE. WE
WERE THE FIRST TO MAKE METIS
LLAMA 2 MODEL AVAILABLE THROUGH
A FULLY MANAGED API. AND WE ALSO
RECENTLY ANNOUNCED OUR EXPANDED
COLLABORATION WITH ANTHROPIC. SO
ANTHROPIC IS A LONG TIME AWS
CUSTOMER AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S
LEADING FOUNDATION MODEL
PROVIDERS. THEIR MODELS CLAUDE
AND THEY GOT OTHERS AS WELL
EXCEL AT A WIDE RANGE OF TASKS
FROM SOPHISTICATED DIALOG AND
CREATIVE CONTENT GENERATION TO
COMPLEX REASONING AND DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS. SO AS PART OF THE
COLLABORATION, ANTHROPIC IS
GOING TO USE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA TO TRAIN FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF THEIR MODELS AND
BEDROCK CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO
HAVE EARLY ACCESS, NOT AVAILABLE
ON OTHER CLOUDS TO UNIQUE
FEATURES FOR MODEL CUSTOMIZATION
AND FINE TUNING CAPABILITIES. SO
TO DIG IN ON WHAT WE'RE DOING
WITH ANTHROPIC, I'D LIKE TO
BRING OUT OUR PARTNER DARIO
OMODEI, WHO'S THE CEO AND
CO-FOUNDER OF ANTHROPIC. LET'S
GIVE HIM A HAND. AS WELL. ALL
RIGHT. WE HAVE CHAIRS. LET'S SIT
. DARIO THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. YEAH.
EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
CLAUDE IS AVAILABLE ON BEDROCK,
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT,
LET'S JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS ABOUT
AND WHAT MAKES CLAUDE SO UNIQUE.
YES SO ANTHROPIC WAS FOUNDED ON
THE IDEA THAT WE CAN MAKE AI
MODELS THAT ARE SAFE, RELIABLE
AND STEERABLE WHILE STILL BEING
HIGHLY CAPABLE. THE FOUNDERS OF
ANTHROPIC WERE A SET OF PEOPLE
WHO WORKED AT OPENAI FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. WE DEVELOPED IDEAS LIKE
GPT THREE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK, SCALING
LAWS FOR LANGUAGE MODELS. SOME
OF THE KEY IDEAS BEHIND THE
CURRENT GENERATIVE AI BOOM.
SEVEN OF US LEFT AND FOUNDED
ANTHROPIC, OUR FOUNDATION MODEL
CLAUDE. IN ADDITION TO BEING
SAFE AND RELIABLE, EXCELS AT A
LOT OF KNOWLEDGE WORK TASKS LIKE
CONTENT, GENERATION,
SUMMARIZATION, Q&A, COMPLEX
REASONING, THINGS LIKE THAT. WE
HAVE AN INDUSTRY LEADING CONTEXT
WINDOW OF 200 K TOKENS. THAT'S
ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH MAKES
IT WELL SUITED FOR AREAS LIKE
LEGAL FINANCE, INSURANCE,
CODING, THINGS LIKE THAT. AND
ABOUT HALF OF THE FORTUNE 500
ARE USING OR ARE TESTING CLAUDE.
SO AMAZING PROGRESS. SO JUST A
FEW MONTHS AGO, OBVIOUSLY AMAZON
AND ANTHROPIC ANNOUNCED KIND OF
AN ENHANCED STRATEGIC
COLLABORATION ANTHROPIC NAMED
AWS IS YOUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO
BE TRAINING AND DEPLOYING FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF CLAUDE AND
FOUNDATION MODELS ON AWS. SO
JUST TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT LED
UP TO THIS AND HOW THAT
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANTHROPIC
AND AWS GROW? YEAH. SO ANTHROPIC
USE OF AWS GOES BACK TO OUR
EARLY HISTORY BACK ALL THE WAY
IN THE MIDST OF TIME IN 2021. WE
CAN REMEMBER THAT, RIGHT? WE
TRAINED OUR FIRST. WE TRAINED
OUR FIRST MODEL ON AWS. AND SO
WE'RE EXCITED NOW TO SAY THAT
YOU GUYS ARE OUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS. I WOULD SAY THE
PARTNERSHIP HAS THREE
COMPONENTS. FIRST IS THE COMPUTE
SIDE, WHICH I JUST DISCUSSED,
WHICH WE'VE BEEN DOING
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY. THE SECOND IS ON THE
PROVISION TO CUSTOMER SIDE.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT
AMAZON BEDROCK WE REALLY
RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THAT WE
COULD PROVIDE TO CUSTOMERS
WORKING TOGETHER AND THE THIRD
SIDE IS THE HARDWARE. WE'RE
CURRENTLY WORKING WITH YOU GUYS
TO OPTIMIZE THESE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA FOR OUR USE CASES AND
HOPEFULLY FOR OTHER USE CASES.
AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE
CAN ACHIEVE THAT FOREX FASTER
THAN THE FIRST GENERATION
TRAINIUM THAT YOU JUST
ANNOUNCED. IF WE OPTIMIZE THESE
THINGS TOGETHER. AND SO PUTTING
TOGETHER THESE THREE PIECES,
LAYERS OF THE STACK REALLY
ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE THINGS TO
CUSTOMERS TOGETHER THAT COULDN'T
BE PROVIDED BEFORE THINGS LIKE
CUSTOMIZATION OF MODELS USE OF
PROPRIETARY DATA AND UNIQUE FINE
TUNING FEATURES. WELL, IT'S THE
RESPECT WE HAVE FOR YOU GUYS IS
JUST TREMENDOUS. I MEAN, TRULY
WORLD CLASS EXPERTISE FOR THE
ANTHROPIC TEAM. I'VE REALLY
ENJOYED WORKING TOGETHER AND THE
MODELS ARE JUST SO POWERFUL. SO
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE AIMING TO AND I
THINK WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
IMPROVING AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES THROUGH
THIS COLLABORATION. TITAN AND OF
COURSE OUR OWN AMAZON DEVELOPERS
ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO ANTHROPIC
MODELS ON BEDROCK AND THROUGHOUT
THE COMPANY. AND WE'RE NOT ONLY
WORKING TO PROVIDE HOOD
CUSTOMERS WITH, WITH, WITH THIS,
BUT WE'RE GIVING THEM EARLY
ACCESS TO UNIQUE FEATURES THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
GET ANYWHERE ELSE. AND WE'RE OUT
THERE TOGETHER WITH OUR
GENERATIVE AI INNOVATION CENTER,
WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE
FIELD, HELPING THEM TO ACTUALLY
GET GET TARGETED. AND THAT'S
ALLOWING US, OF COURSE, TO BRING
THIS EXPERTISE AND THE DOMAIN
SPECIFIC EXPERTISE THAT THEY
NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS.
AND AS WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE
TOGETHER AND IT'S BEEN HOT AND
HEAVY, PARTICULARLY THE PAST FEW
WEEKS, BUT BEFORE THAT AS WELL,
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST
INTERESTING USE CASES THAT
YOU'VE SEEN? YEAH SO I'LL GIVE
THREE EXAMPLES ACROSS DIFFERENT
INDUSTRIES. THERE'S MANY OTHERS,
BUT THIS SHOULD GIVE GIVE A
SENSE OF THE RANGE. AND WE WE'VE
SEEN A LOT OF ORGANIC ADOPTION.
ONE EXAMPLE IN THE BIOMEDICAL
SPACE WE'RE HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE
WE'RE WORKING WITH PFIZER. I'M A
FORMER BIOLOGIST MYSELF, SO I'M
REALLY EXCITED FOR ANY WAY I CAN
CAN ADVANCE MEDICAL SCIENCE AND
BRING BRING LIFE SAVING DRUGS TO
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND THE
LEGAL SPACE. WE MADE A CUSTOM
FINE TUNED MODEL, DEPLOYED IT TO
YOU GUYS FOR LEXISNEXIS TO HELP
WITH THEIR LEGAL SEARCH. YOU
KNOW, IN A WAY THAT'S KIND OF
FACT BASED AND PRODUCE CITATIONS
. AND IN THE FINANCE SPACE,
WE'RE WORKING WITH BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES TO DEVELOP AN
INVESTMENT ANALYST, ASSISTANT.
BUT BEYOND THAT, JUST SOME
EXAMPLES. WE'VE ENGAGED WITH
SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF SOME OF THE
LARGEST PLAYERS IN THE INSURANCE
AND BANKING INDUSTRIES AND, YOU
KNOW, COULD TELL SIMILAR STORIES
ABOUT OTHER INDUSTRIES. SO, YOU
KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE
NEW USE CASES AND WHERE ALL OF
THIS GOES. THAT'S INCREDIBLE
MOMENTUM. JUST THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES EXAMPLE TO BE WORKING
WITH WITH THAT MANY LEADERS. SO
JUST LAST WEEK YOU'RE NOT
STANDING STILL, RIGHT. SO JUST
LAST WEEK YOU ANNOUNCED CLAUDE
2.1. SO THAT'S GOT A WHOLE LOT
OF NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN KEY
CAPABLE CITIES. MAYBE YOU CAN
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.
YEAH. SO CLAUDE 2.1 REALLY IS A
RELEASE THAT'S TARGETED AT
ENTERPRISES. SO A FEW DIFFERENT
FEATURES. ONE IS WE'VE DOUBLED
OUR CONTEXT WINDOW TO 200,000
TOKENS. TOKENS IS A TERM OF ART
IN THE AI SPACE. WHAT IT AMOUNTS
TO IS ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH
IS A RELATIVELY LONG BOOK. AND
SO USE CASES LIKE READING
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, READING AN
ENTIRE LONG BOOK. AND ONE OF MY
FAVORITES, PUTTING MULTIPLE
DOCUMENTS IN THE CONTEXT WINDOW
AND ASKING THE MODEL TO COMPARE
THEM OR INTEGRATE THEM. A SECOND
FEATURE IS THAT WE'VE REDUCED
THE RATE OF SO-CALLED
HALLUCINATIONS, WHICH IS WHEN
MODELS SAY THINGS THAT AREN'T
TRUE TO BY BY ABOUT TWO X WE'VE
SEEN ACROSS THE INDUSTRY A CORE
OBSTACLE TO DEPLOYMENT IN THE
ENTERPRISE WORLD IS PEOPLE ARE
WORRIED THAT MODELS WILL SAY
THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE. NO ONE
HAS PERFECTLY SOLVED THIS
PROBLEM, BUT WE ARE REALLY
LEADING THE WAY IN GETTING MORE
AND MORE REDUCTIONS AND THEN WE
ALSO HAVE SOME BETA FEATURES AS
WE'RE INTRODUCING SYSTEM PROMPTS
FOR TOOL USE AS A BETA FEATURE
AND A DEVELOPER WORKBENCH.
AGAIN, ALL TOOLS TARGETED AT
PEOPLE BUILDING FOR ENTERPRISES.
WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE ALL THE USE
CASES THAT EMERGE FROM THIS. I'M
SPEECHLESS. YES, THAT IS SUCH
INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. YES. I
MEAN, YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU
TALKED ABOUT THE REDUCTION OF
HALLUCINATION, A REALLY
IMPORTANT TOPIC. YOU JUST MORE
BROADLY, I THINK WE SHARE A
BELIEF THAT I SHOULD BE SAFE,
SECURE, RESPONSIBLE AND BENEFIT
SOCIETY. AND WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED
A LOT OF GROUPS AND
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROMOTING
THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT
OF RESPONSIBLE AI IN FACT, I
KEEP BUMPING INTO DARIA AROUND
THE WORLD AT SOME OF THESE
VARIOUS GATHERINGS, WHICH IS
NICE. SO I KNOW THIS IS A
PARTICULAR PASSION OF YOURS. AND
CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT ANTHROPIC WORK IN
THIS AREA? YEAH I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING WE
WERE FOUNDED ON AND THAT WE CARE
ABOUT DEEPLY. WE I WOULD
CATEGORIZE IT INTO TWO AREAS
WHERE WE'VE DONE WORK IN THIS
AREA. ONE IS THE WAY WE DESIGN
OUR OWN MODELS AND THE OTHER IS
THE WAY THAT WE TRY TO SET AN
EXAMPLE FOR THE ECOSYSTEM AND
BRING OTHERS ALONG SO THAT
ULTIMATELY EVERYONE BECOMES
SAFER AND MORE RELIABLE. SO
LARGE FRACTION ON THE FIRST ONE,
A LARGE FRACTION OF OUR RESEARCH
ORG WORKS ON SAFETY. WE PUT A
LOT OF WORK INTO MAKING OUR
MODELS HARD TO BREAK, MAKING
THEM SECURE AGAINST MISUSE AND
HARMFUL USE. THERE WAS A RECENT
STUDY OUT OF CARNEGIE MELLON
WHERE PEOPLE TRIED TO
ADVERSARIALLY BREAK DIFFERENT
MODELS AND IT FOUND THAT THEY
WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY BREAK
CLAUDE TEN TIMES LESS OFTEN THAN
THEY WERE ABLE TO BREAK THE
COMPETITOR'S MODEL. SO THERE'S A
REAL DIFFERENCE HERE. A SECOND
WE'VE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO
INTERPRETABILITY SEEING INSIDE
THE MODELS. THERE'S NO
COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENTS ON THAT
SO FAR. BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG ARC
AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT RELATIVELY
SOON FOR BOTH COMPLIANCE AND FOR
UNDERSTANDING WHAT MODELS DO AND
THEREFORE REDUCING BAD BEHAVIOR
FROM THE MODELS, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE
WIDER ECOSYSTEM. YOU KNOW, WE
ALWAYS TRY TO CREATE A RACE TO
THE TOP, DO SOMETHING, AND THEN
COMPETITORS, OTHER PLAYERS IN
THE ECOSYSTEM, FOLLOW ALONG AND
DO THE SAME THING. AN EXAMPLE OF
THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE SCALING
POLICY WHERE WE FRONT LOADED
SAFETY INVESTMENT AHEAD OF MODEL
SCALING, A KIND OF
PRE-DEPLOYMENT TESTING REGIME
LIKE WHAT'S DONE FOR CARS AND
AIRPLANES. AND IN THE POLICY
SPACE, WE'VE CONTINUALLY
ADVOCATED FOR GOVERNMENTS TO
BUILD UP THEIR ABILITY TO
EVALUATE AND MEASURE AI SYSTEMS
AS IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO EVALUATE
AND MEASURE THINGS, WE'LL GET
EITHER NO REGULATION OR POORLY
INFORMED REGULATION. WE NEED TO
ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE CAN DEVELOP QUICKLY,
RESPONSIBLY, BUT IN A WAY THAT'S
SECURE. I JUST LOVE THE CONCEPT
OF THE RACE TO THE TOP. IT'S SO
POSITIVE. AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS SO AMAZING. I MEAN, WE'VE
SAID IT THE WHOLE 17 YEARS THAT
AWS HAS BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES
THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT GIVES US
ENERGY IS JUST WORKING WITH THE
COOLEST, MOST CUTTING EDGE, YOU
KNOW, STARTUPS AND ENTREPRENEURS
IN THE WORLD. AND THERE IS JUST
NO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN GENERATIVE AI NOW.
AND WHAT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS
DOING. SO IT'S GREAT TO BE
PARTNERING TOGETHER SO DEEPLY
AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
JOINING ME HERE ON STAGE TODAY.
YEAH, EXCITED FOR EVERYTHING WE
CAN DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU. ALL
RIGHT.
ALL RIGHTY. SO THAT'S AMAZING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN, DARIA,
FOR COMING OUT AND JOINING US.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. SO THE
INNOVATION AROUND GENERATIVE AI
MODELS IS EXPLOSIVE AND WE
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
WITH ALL OF OUR BEDROCK PARTNERS
FOR YEARS TO COME. INCREDIBLY
INNOVATIVE SPACE. AND WE'RE ALSO
EXCITED ABOUT THE LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS THAT WE'RE BUILDING
OURSELVES AT AMAZON SO OUR
AMAZON TITAN MODELS WERE CREATED
AND PRE-TRAINED BY AWS, AND
WE'RE BUILDING OUR OWN MODELS IN
ORDER TO BRING ACTUALLY A FEW
BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS. SO WE DO
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE HERE. I
MEAN, AMAZON HAS BEEN WORKING ON
AI FOR 25 YEARS. I'VE GOT A LONG
TRACK RECORD. WE USE THE
TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR BUSINESS
AND WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
BUILDING AND DEPLOYING MODELS.
AND AS A RESULT, WE CAN PROVIDE
A WHOLE RANGE OF MODELS THAT
OFFER REALLY POWERFUL
CAPABILITIES AND ALSO GREAT
ECONOMICS TO SUPPORT A WHOLE
BUNCH OF USE CASES AND WE
CAREFULLY CHOOSE HOW WE TRAIN
OUR MODELS AND THE DATA THAT WE
USE TO DO SO. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY
GOING TO INDEMNIFY CUSTOMERS
AGAINST CLAIMS THAT OUR MODELS
OR THEIR OUTPUTS INFRINGE ON
ANYBODY'S COPYRIGHT. NOW, THERE
ARE ALREADY MULTIPLE MODELS IN
THE TITAN FAMILY. WE'VE GOT
TITAN TEXT LITE, WHICH IS IDEAL
FOR TEXT BASED TASKS LIKE
SUMMARIZATION. WE'VE ALSO GOT
TITAN TEXT EXPRESS, WHICH IS
GREAT FOR MORE ADVANCED GENERAL
LANGUAGE TASKS LIKE COPY
EDITING, COPYWRITING AND WE'VE
ALSO GOT THE TITAN TEXT
EMBEDDINGS MODEL FOR SEARCH USE
CASES OR PERSONALIZATION AND
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ADDING
MODELS TO THE TITAN FAMILY. AND
IF YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT, THEN
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TUNE INTO
SWAMI'S KEYNOTE TOMORROW. A
LITTLE, LITTLE WORD UP NOW, ALL
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE
ALL EXTREMELY CAPABLE AND THEY
ALL ENABLE A LOT OF GREAT
APPLICATIONS. BUT TO REALLY
DRIVE YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED
GENERATIVE AI THAT UNDERSTANDS
YOUR BUSINESS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
CUSTOMERS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
PRODUCTS, YOUR OPERATIONS. AND
THAT'S ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN YOU
USE YOUR OWN DATA TO IMPROVE AND
CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS. THE MODELS
HAVE TO BECOME UNIQUE TO YOU. SO
AMAZON BEDROCK IS GIVING YOU ALL
OF THE PURPOSE BUILT
CAPABILITIES THAT YOU NEED TO
CUSTOMIZE THE AI APPLICATIONS
WITH YOUR OWN DATA. SO WITH A
FEW CLICKS YOU CAN GO FROM
GENERIC APPLICATIONS TO ONES
THAT ARE HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND
HIGHLY TAILORED. SO ONE
IMPORTANT TECHNIQUE IS CALLED
FINE TUNING. NOW, WITH FINE
TUNING, YOU POINT THE MODELS TO
EXAMPLES OF DATA IN S3 THAT
YOU'VE LABELED LABELED TO
PROVIDE CONTEXT. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU MIGHT POINT TO PROPOSALS AND
YOU'VE LABELED SOME OF THOSE
PROPOSALS AS STRONG. SO IN THIS
WAY THE MODEL LEARNS FROM YOU,
LEARNS FROM YOUR DATA. WHAT
MATTERS THE MOST TO YOU. AND
THEN BEDROCK MAKES A COPY OF THE
BASE MODELS. IT TRAINS IT, IT
CREATES A PRIVATE FINE TUNED
MODEL SO YOU GET TAILORED
RESPONSES. SO FINE TUNING IS
AVAILABLE IN AMAZON TITAN TEXT
LITE AND EXPRESS, AND TODAY IT'S
ALSO GENERALLY AVAILABLE FOR
COHERE COMMAND LITE AND META
LLAMA 2 AND FINE TUNING IS
COMING TO ANTHROPIC CLAUDE SOON.
SO A SECOND TECHNIQUE FOR
TAILORING TAILORING FOUNDATION
MODELS FOR YOUR BUSINESS IS
CALLED RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED
GENERATION OR RAG ANOTHER ONE OF
THE TERMS YOU SEE OUT THERE A
LOT. SO RAG ALLOWS YOU TO
CUSTOMIZE A MODEL'S RESPONSES
WHEN YOU WANT THE MODEL TO
CONSIDER NEW KNOWLEDGE OR UP TO
DATE INFORMATION. SO BEDROCK
DOES THIS FOR YOU BY CALLING AND
BRINGING BACK YOUR OWN DATA,
YOUR DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES,
INCLUDING DOCUMENT REPOSITORIES,
DATABASES AND OTHER APIS AND
MORE SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MODEL
MIGHT USE RAG TO RETRIEVE SEARCH
RESULTS FROM OUR AMAZON
OPENSEARCH SERVICE OR DOCUMENTS
FROM S3. AND IN SEPTEMBER, WE
INTRODUCED A RAG CAPABILITY
CALLED KNOWLEDGE BASES THAT
CONNECTS FM TO YOUR PROPRIETARY
DATA SOURCES TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR
PROMPTS WITH MORE INFORMATION
AND TODAY KNOWLEDGE BASES IS
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NOW, A
THIRD WAY THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE
MODELS INSIDE OF BEDROCK IS A
TECHNIQUE CALLED CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING. SO CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT
USES LARGE AMOUNTS OF UNLABELED
DATA BEFORE YOU FINE TUNE IT.
YOU DID THE LABELED DATA HERE IS
UNLABELED DATA LIKE THE RAW TEXT
OF INTERNAL REPORTS, FINANCIAL
PLANS OR RESEARCH RESULTS THAT
YOU HAVE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE
USED TO IMPROVE THE MODELS,
KNOWLEDGE AND ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES USING THINGS IN
YOUR OWN SPECIFIC DOMAIN. SO
CONTINUED PRE-TRAINING IS OF
COURSE AVAILABLE IN BEDROCK
TODAY. NOW ALL OF THESE
TECHNIQUES, THEY'RE ALL POWERFUL
TOOLS IN MAKING GENERATIVE AI
TARGETED, MAKING IT TRULY USEFUL
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND BEDROCK
MAKES IT REALLY EASY TO COMBINE
THESE TECHNIQUES TOGETHER. SO A
GREAT EXAMPLE OF A CUSTOMER
USING BEDROCK TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR
GENERATIVE AI AI APPLICATIONS IS
DELTA AIRLINES. SO DELTA IS
ACTUALLY MODERNIZING ITS
CUSTOMER SERVICE CAPABILITY WITH
GENERATIVE AI AI BUILT ON AMAZON
BEDROCK. THE NEW TOOL IS GOING
TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS IN A MORE RELEVANT AND
CONVERSATIONAL STYLE BY
ACCESSING DELTA'S TRAVEL
POLICIES, REAL TIME FLIGHT
SCHEDULES, CUSTOMER REBOOKING
OPTIONS AND AIRPORT CONDITIONS.
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD
RESPOND TO SIMPLE QUESTIONS LIKE
HOW MANY BAGS CAN I CHECK ON A
DELTA FLIGHT? AND IT CAN ALSO DO
MORE COMPLEX QUESTIONS LIKE CAN
I CARRY MY CAT WITH ME IN THE
CABIN TO JAMAICA? OF COURSE.
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH YOUR CAT?
DELTA'S BEEN
TESTING WITH DIFFERENT
FOUNDATION MODELS IN BEDROCK,
INCLUDING ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 2.0
CLAUDE INSTANT AND A FINE TUNED
AMAZON TITAN TEXT EXPRESS MODEL.
AND THIS WAY THEY CAN USE THE
RIGHT MODEL TO ANSWER DIFFERENT
CUSTOMER QUESTIONS IN. IT'S A
REALLY POWERFUL HOW THEY CAN
COMBINE THE MOST RELEVANT
INFORMATION NEEDED TO ANSWER ANY
SPECIFIC QUESTION. NOW, WITH THE
NEW CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOL
DELTA AIRLINES IS AIMING TO
PROVIDE A DELIGHTFUL AND
CONVERSATIONAL SELF-SERVICE
EXPERIENCE AND IT'S GOING TO
IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SO
EVERYONE WANTS MORE RELEVANT
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS,
RIGHT? AND BEDROCK IS MAKING IT
A LOT EASIER TO CUSTOMIZE THOSE
APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR OWN DATA.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU
WANT FMS TO DO MORE THAN JUST
PROVIDE USEFUL AND TARGETED
INFORMATION AND ULTIMATELY WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT IS TO USE
FMS TO TAKE ACTION TO ACTUALLY
GET THINGS DONE AND WE WANTED
YOU TO BE ABLE TO USE BEDROCK TO
COMPLETE ACTIONS LIKE BOOKING
TRAVEL, FILING INSURANCE CLAIMS,
DEPLOYING SOFTWARE, MAYBE
ORDERING REPLACEMENT PARTS. AND
THIS USUALLY REQUIRES
ORCHESTRATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE
SYSTEMS THAT OPERATE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S WHY A
FEW MONTHS AGO, WE INTRODUCED
AGENTS FOR BEDROCK. AND TODAY
I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS
POWERFUL FEATURE IS TODAY.
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. NOW WITH
AGENTS GENAI APPLICATIONS CAN
EXECUTE MULTI-STEP TASKS ACROSS
COMPANY SYSTEMS AND DATA SOURCES
FROM ANSWERING CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS ABOUT PRODUCT
AVAILABLE IOT TO TAKING A SALES
ORDER AND MORE AND BUILDING WITH
AGENTS IS REALLY EASY. FIRST,
YOU USE BEDROCK SETUP WIZARD TO
SELECT THE APPROPRIATE MODEL.
THEN YOU GIVE THE MODEL BASIC
INSTRUCTIONS TO HELP THE MODEL
UNDERSTAND HOW TO RESPOND. LIKE
YOU ARE A FRIENDLY CUSTOMER
SERVICE AGENT WHO HELPS
CUSTOMERS RETURN ITEMS. NEXT,
YOU SPECIFY THE LAMBDA FUNCTIONS
THAT EXECUTE THE API CALLS TO
RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION THAT'S
RELEVANT TO THE TASK. FOR
EXAMPLE, RETURN POLICIES OR
INVENTORY LEVELS. AND FINALLY,
YOU SELECT THE DATA SOURCES.
THEN YOU JUST SELECT, CREATE
AGENT AND BEDROCK, CONFIGURES
YOUR AGENT AND IT IS NOW READY
TO RUN WHEN THE AGENT RECEIVES A
REQUEST, IT USES ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES TO ANALYZE AND TO
PLAN THE TASK. AND THE MODEL
WORKS OUT THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS.
THE INFORMATION NEEDED, THE APIS
TO CALL AND WHEN TO CALL THEM.
THEN IT EXECUTE BETZ THE PLAN,
TAKING ALL THE STEPS THAT IT
NEEDS TO GATHER THE INFORMATION
AND THEN COMPLETE THE TASK. ALL
IN THE BACKGROUND. NO NEED TO
ENGINEER PROMPT, NO NEED TO
TRAIN THE FMS. NO NEED TO
MANUALLY CONNECT SYSTEMS WITH
AGENTS. GENERATIVE AI IS
BECOMING AN INTEGRAL PART OF
YOUR BUSINESS. MAKING IT EASY TO
TAKE ACTIONS AND GET TASKS DONE.
NO HEAVY LIFTING REQUIRED SO
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW BEDROCK
IS MAKING IT EASY TO CHOOSE
AMONGST LEADING MODELS AND ALSO
HOW IT GIVES YOU SO MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA AND HOW IT CAN
HELP COMBINE THE POWER OF MODELS
INTO YOUR ORGANIZATION'S
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA'S AND YOUR
API TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION. BUT
YOU WON'T ACTUALLY USE ANY OF
THIS IN A SERIOUS WAY IF IT
ISN'T SECURE AND PRIVATE.
I MEAN, YOU DEMAND THE
SAME ROCK SOLID RELIABILITY. THE
SAME SECURITY FOR GENERATIVE AI
THAT YOU DO FOR ANY WORKLOAD,
AND YOU REALLY NEED THIS TO HAVE
NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS
THAN EVERYTHING YOU EXPECT FROM
AN AWS SERVICE. IT'S JUST LIKE
S3. EC2. RDS. BEDROCK HAS GOT TO
HAVE ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
FEATURES TO MAKE YOUR DATA SAFE
AND PRIVATE, AND THAT'S WHAT IT
HAS. BEDROCK CUSTOMERS CAN TRUST
THAT THEIR DATA REMAINS
PROTECTED. NO CUSTOMER DATA IS
GOING TO BE USED TO TRAIN OR
IMPROVE THE ORIGINAL BASE
MODELS. WHEN YOU TUNE A MODEL,
WE MAKE A PRIVATE COPY OF THAT
MODEL. WE PUT IT IN A SECURE
CONTAINER AND IT GOES NOWHERE.
YOUR DATA IS NEVER EXPOSED TO
THE PUBLIC INTERNET, NEVER
LEAVES THE AWS NETWORK. IT'S
SECURELY TRANSFERRED THROUGH
YOUR VPC. IT'S ENCRYPTED IN
TRANSIT AND AT REST AND BEDROCK
ENFORCES THE SAME AWS ACCESS
CONTROLS YOU HAVE WITH ANY OF
OUR OTHER SERVICES AS BEDROCK
ALSO SUPPORTS A VARIETY OF
REGULATORY STANDARDS. IT'S HIPAA
ELIGIBLE. IT CAN BE USED IN
COMPLIANCE WITH GDPR. WE'VE
ADDED A BUNCH OF OTHER SECURITY
AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITIES,
INCLUDING INTEGRATIONS WITH
CLOUDWATCH TO TRACK USAGE AND
METRICS. CLOUDTRAIL TO MONITOR
API ACTIVITY AND TROUBLESHOOT
ACTIVITY. AND TODAY BEDROCK IS
SOC COMPLIANT. NOW THIS HELPS A
CUSTOMER ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS
CAN HAVE STRONG CONTROLS AND
POLICIES IN PLACE AND HELPS IT
BE USED IN EVERY BUSINESS. NOW,
BEYOND SECURITY, WE NEED
GENERATIVE AI TO BE DEPLOYED IN
A SAFE, TRUSTWORTHY AND RESPONSE
ABLE FASHION. LIKE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND
THAT'S OUR NORTH STAR FOR THE
CAPABILITIES THAT MAKE GENAI
SUCH A PROMISING TOOL FOR
INNOVATION. ALSO, DO INCREASE
THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE. WE'VE
GOT TO FIND WAYS TO UNLOCK
GENERATIVE AI AI'S FULL
POTENTIAL WHILE MITIGATING THE
RISKS. NOW, DEALING WITH THIS
CHALLENGE IS GOING TO REQUIRE
UNPRECEDENTED COLLABORATION AND
A TRULY MULTI-STAKEHOLDER EFFORT
ACROSS TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES,
POLICY MAKERS, COMMUNITY GROUPS,
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES AND
ACADEMICS. WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATING IN A LOT OF THE
GROUPS THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER
TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES EARLIER
THIS YEAR, I JOINED PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS
LIKE DARIO AS HE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'VE MADE A SERIES OF VOLUNTARY
COMMITMENTS TO PROMOTING THE
SAFE, THE SECURE AND THE
TRANSPARENT DEVELOPMENT OF AI
TECHNOLOGY. AND JUST THIS MONTH,
I JOINED A UK PRIME MINISTER
SUNAK, FOR HIS AI SAFETY SUMMIT
TO DISCUSS NEW APPROACHES,
INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF THEIR
NEW AI SAFETY INSTITUTE. NOW AN
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF
RESPONSIBLE AI IS PROMOTING THE
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOUR
CONSUMERS AND THE APPLICATIONS
THAT ARE SAFE THAT AVOID HARMFUL
OUTPUTS AND THAT STAY WITHIN
YOUR COMPANY'S GUIDELINES. AND
THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO
ACTUALLY PLACE LIMITS ON WHAT
INFORMATION THE MODELS CAN AND
CAN'T RETURN. AND WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD HERE, AND TODAY
WE'RE ANNOUNCING GUARDRAILS FOR
AMAZON BEDROCK. NOW THIS IS A
NEW CAPABILITY THAT HELPS YOU
EASILY SAFEGUARD YOUR GENERATIVE
AI APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR
RESPONSIBLE AI POLICIES TO
CREATE A GUARDRAIL. BEDROCK
PROVIDES CONFIGURATION WIZARD SO
YOU CAN ENTER A NATURAL LANGUAGE
DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPICS THAT
YOU WANT. THE MODEL TO AVOID.
GUARDRAILS CAN BE USED WITH ANY
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS
ACCESSIBLE VIA BEDROCK,
INCLUDING THE CUSTOM MODELS THAT
YOU CREATE THROUGH YOUR OWN FINE
TUNING AND YOU CAN ALSO USE
GUARDRAILS WITH AGENTS. SO NOW
YOU CAN HAVE A CONSISTENT LEVEL
OF PROTECTION ACROSS ALL OF YOUR
GENAI GENAI DEVELOPMENT
ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, A BANK
COULD CONFIGURE AN ONLINE
ASSISTANT TO REFRAIN FROM
PROVIDING INVESTMENT ADVICE OR
TO PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT
. AN E COMMERCE SITE COULD
ENSURE THAT ITS ONLINE ASSISTANT
DOESN'T USE HATE SPEECH OR
INSULTS OR A UTILITY COMPANY
COULD REMOVE PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR PII
FROM A CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL
SUMMARY. SO WE'RE APPROACHING
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF GENERATIVE
AI IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT
WAY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT
IT TAKES TO REINVENT. HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO BUILD WITH THIS
TECHNOLOGY? WE JUST, AS YOU'VE
USED AWS TO REINVENT HOW YOU'VE
BUILT AND INNOVATE IT FOR YEARS
AND ULTIMATELY TO TRANSFORM HOW
YOUR ORGANIZATION OPERATES,
WHETHER YOU'RE MIGRATING
ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS,
BUILDING THE NEXT HOT STARTUP OR
OR DEPLOYING YOUR GENERATIVE AI
STRATEGY. OUR APPROACH REMAINS
THE SAME. UM, CUSTOMER
OBSESSION, INNOVATION AND A LONG
TERM VIEW OF WHAT JOINT SUCCESS
REALLY MEANS. TO TELL US MORE
ABOUT HOW HER COMPANY IS BUILT
ON AWS AND IS NOW REINVENTING
WITH GENERATIVE AI, PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE LIDIA
FONSECA, THE CHIEF DIGITAL AND
TECHNICAL OFFICER OF PFIZER.
THANK EVERYBODY. I'D LIKE TO
START BY ASKING HOW MANY
PATIENTS DO YOU THINK PFIZER
TREATED LAST YEAR? YOU MAY BE
THINKING IN THE MILLIONS, BUT IN
FACT WE TREATED 1.3 BILLION
PATIENTS WITH OUR MEDICINES AND
VACCINES. THAT'S ONE OUT OF SIX
HUMANS ON THE PLANET. A TRULY
HUMBLING, ACCOMPLISHED AGENT.
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE
RECOGNIZED AS AN INNOVATIVE AND
ETHICAL COMPANY LISTED IN
FORTUNE'S WORLD'S MOST ADMIRED
COMPANIES. FORBES WORLD'S BEST
EMPLOYERS, AND TIME MAGAZINE'S
WORLD'S BEST COMPANIES, PFIZER
IS EXPERIENCING AN EXCITING
PERIOD OF INNOVATION AND GROWTH
WITH THE LAUNCH OF 90 MEDICINES
AND VACCINES IN 18 MONTHS. THIS
HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BY US OR ANY
OTHER PHARMA COMPANY. IT IS AN
INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS GOAL AND WE
ARE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 13
ALREADY LAUNCHED DIGITAL DATA
AND AI ARE CRITICAL TO OUR
SUCCESS. AS AND WHAT
DIFFERENTIATES PFIZER IS THAT WE
APPLY THIS ACROSS ALL BUSINESS
UNITS. OUR 36 PLANTS AND THE 149
MARKETS THAT WE SERVE QUICKLY
AND AT SCALE TO BRING MEDICINES
TO PATIENTS FASTER. OUR SUCCESS
TODAY RESTS ON THE GROUNDWORK WE
LAID FOR TECHNOLOGY AND AI TO
FLOURISH. CENTRAL IZING OUR
DATA, CREATE STANDARD PLATFORMS,
CULTIVATING STRONG TALENT AND
BUILDING A SECURE FOUNDATION IN
ALL TO INNOVATE FOR MAXIMUM
IMPACT. WE COULD NOT HAVE
ACHIEVED THIS TREMENDOUS REACH
WITHOUT OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
WITH AWS. SO LET ME SHARE A BIT
ABOUT OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER. IN
2019 PFIZER AND AWS CREATED A
PIONEERING SCIENCE DATA CLOUD
THAT AGGREGATES MULTIMODAL DATA
FROM HUNDREDS OF LABORATORY
INSTRUMENTS, EMPOWERING OUR
SCIENTISTS TO SEARCH ALL
HISTORICAL MOLECULE AND COMPOUND
DATA IN REAL TIME COMPARED TO
WEEKS OR MONTHS IN OUR PRIOR
FRAGMENTED ENVIRONMENT AND THE
SCIENTIFIC DATA CLOUD
ACCELERATES ANALYSIS AND
COMPUTATION OF RESEARCH AND WITH
AI ALGORITHMS THAT HELP US
IDENTIFY AND DESIGN THE MOST
PROMISING NEW MOLECULES IS
BUILDING ON THAT SUCCESS IN
2021. PFIZER EMBARKED ON ONE OF
OUR BOLDEST INITIATIVE IS GOING
FROM 10% OF OUR CORE IN THE TO
CLOUD 80% MOVING IN 12,000
APPLICATIONS AND 8000 SERVERS IN
42 WEEKS. ONE OF THE FASTEST
MIGRATIONS FOR A COMPANY OUR
SIZE. THIS MOVE TO AWS SAVED US
$47 MILLION A YEAR AND HELPED US
EXIT THREE DATA CENTERS,
REDUCING 4700 TONS OF CO2
EMISSIONS OR THE EQUIVALENT
ENERGY USE BY 1000 HOMES IN A
YEAR. BUT VERY IMPORTANT ALI. IT
ENABLED US TO INNOVATE WITH
SPEED AND AT SCALE. FOR EXAMPLE,
WE REDUCED TIME TO SET UP
COMPUTING CAPACITY FROM MONTHS
TO HOURS, SPEEDING UP DATA
GENERATION FOR DRUG SUBMISSIONS
BY. 75. AND WHEN COVID HIT, AWS
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO OFFER
THEIR HELP, SCALING US INTO THE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL
CORES IN THE CLOUD AND
ACCELERATING MANUFACTURING AND
CLINICAL TRIALS. WHEN WE RAN
COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE
ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO
MANUFACTURE OUR COVID VACCINE,
AWS JUMPED IN WITH ADDITIONAL
CPUS FOR US TO MOVE FAST. AND
WHEN WE NEEDED TO SUBMIT DATA TO
THE FDA IN UNDER A DAY,
INCREASED OUR CAPACITY IN
ENABLING PFIZER TO MOVE AT THE
SPEED OF SCIENCE. IN FACT, IT
TOOK JUST 269 DAYS FROM WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED OUR PLANS TO DEVELOP A
COVID 19 VACCINE WITH BIONTECH
TO THE DAY THAT WE RECEIVED THE
FDA'S EMERGENCY USE
AUTHORIZATION ACTION. THIS
NORMALLY TAKES 8 TO 10 YEARS.
THANK YOU. WITH THE WORLD
WAITING, WE NEEDED TO
MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE THE
VACCINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
WE HELD FIRM TO OUR MANTRA
SCIENCE WILL WIN. WELL WHILE
SCIENCE DID WIN AND DIGITAL
HELPED US DO IT FASTER, PFIZER
OUR INDUSTRY LEADING DIGITAL
OPERATIONS CENTER ALLOWED US
COLLEAGUES TO SEE PRODUCTION
STATUS ACROSS PLANTS AND RESOLVE
ISSUES IN REAL TIME, YIELDING A
20% THROUGHPUT INCREASE. OUR
MRNA PREDICTION ALGORITHM
YIELDED 20,000 MORE VACCINE
DOSES PER BATCH. IMAGINE THE
LIVES IMPACT IT. TO GIVE YOU AN
IDEA OF THE SCALE, PRIOR TO
COVID, PFIZER PRODUCED 220
MILLION VACCINE DOSES IN TOTAL
AND SCALED TO 4 BILLION OF
COMMUNITY IN 2022. THIS IS NOW
AT THE HEART OF HOW OUR PLANTS
OPERATE, AND WE'RE APPLYING
THESE INNOVATIONS TO THE TO OUR
OTHER MEDICINES AND VACCINES.
MORE RECENTLY, AWS HELPED US
APPLY AI TO GENERATE ALERTS
ABOUT POTENTIAL SUPPLY CHAIN
DISRUPTIONS, PROMPTING US TO
REROUTE SHIPMENTS TO CONTINUE
DELIVERING MEDICINES TO CLINICAL
TRIAL SITES AHEAD OF HURRICANE
IAN'S LANDFALL. DIGITAL AI MADE
IT POSSIBLE FOR PFIZER TO BRING
MEDICINES TO PATIENTS AROUND THE
GLOBE FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE.
NOW LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S NEXT.
AS YOU HEARD, PFIZER HAS BEEN
HARNESSING AI TO DRIVE
INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY ON A
GLOBAL SCALE. AND MORE RECENTLY,
WE ARE LEVERAGING GENERATIVE AI,
WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO DELIVER
ANNUAL COST SAVINGS OF 750
MILLION TO $1 BILLION IN THE
NEAR TERM. SOME REAL TANGIBLE
VALUE TO USING AWS CLOUD
SERVICES. PFIZER QUICKLY
DEPLOYED FOX OUR INTERNAL
GENERATIVE AI PLATFORM ALLOWING
COLLEAGUES TO ACCESS LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS AVAILABLE IN
AMAZON BEDROCK AND SAGEMAKER AWS
BREADTH OF SERVICES AND THE
VARIETY OF LMS IN BEDROCK MEANS
WE CAN SELECT THE BEST TOOLS FOR
USE CASES IN R&D, MANUFACTURE,
MARKETING AND MORE ENABLING
PFIZER AND AWS TO PROTOTYPE 17
DIFFERENT USE CASES IN A MATTER
OF WEEKS. I IN GENERATIVE AI
WILL HELP US IDENTIFY NEW
ONCOLOGY TARGETS, A PROCESS THAT
IS LARGELY MANUAL TODAY WITH AI,
WE CAN SEARCH AND COLLATE
RELEVANT DATA AND SCIENTIFIC
CONTENT FROM MANY MORE SOURCES
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME AND
ALGORITHMS GENERATE AND VALIDATE
POTENTIAL TARGETS TO IMPROVE OUR
SCIENTIFIC SUCCESS WITH BEDROCK,
WE CAN SCAN THE MARKETPLACE FOR
COMPANIES AND ASSETS AUTOMATING
THE CREATION OF COMPANY PROFILES
TO PRIORITIZE POTENTIAL
ACQUISITION ROLES IN
MANUFACTURING. BEDROCK TAKES THE
OPTIMAL PROCESS PARAMETERS TO
IDENTIFY WHAT WE CALL THE GOLDEN
BATCH AND USES GENERATIVE AI TO
DETECT ANOMALIES AND RECOMMEND
ACTIONS TO OUR OPERATORS IN REAL
TIME. AIMING TO IMPROVE CYCLE
TIME BY 25% AWS IS AGILE CULTURE
ALIGNS WELL WITH PFIZER'S
LIGHTSAIL LEAD WAY OF WORKING.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING ON
OUR LEARNINGS TO UNDERSTAND AND
NOT JUST HOW AI CAN TRANSFORM
OUR DAILY WORK, BUT HOW IT MAY
HELP US DISRUPT THE INDUSTRY.
ORI TO CLOSE, WE'RE EXCITED TO
ACCELERATE OUR BATTLE AGAINST
CANCER. WITH PFIZER'S PROPOSED
ACQUISITION OF CDN, A BIOTECH
FOCUSED ON CANCER THERAPY. AS WE
PLAN TO BRING JENS LEADING EDGE
ANTIBODY DRUG CONJUGATE
TECHNOLOGY TO MORE PATIENTS WITH
CANCER, FASTER. YOU SEE, WE HOPE
TO ACHIEVE WITH CANCER WHAT WE
WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH COVID.
OUR WORK WITH THE AWS WILL HELP
US CONTINUE THIS GREAT MOMENTUM
FUELING OUR AMBITION TO CHANGE A
BILLION LIVES EVERY YEAR, NOT
JUST IN A PANDEMIC YEAR. THANK
YOU, AWS FOR HELPING PFIZER
BRING BREAKTHROUGHS TO PATIENTS
FASTER BECAUSE IN THE BATTLE
AGAINST DISEASE, TIME IS LIFE.
THANK YOU ALL. ONE OUT OF EVERY
SIX PEOPLE ON THE PLANET ARE
IMPACTED BY PFIZER. I MEAN, THAT
IS JUST SO IMPRESSIVE. SO
IMPRESSIVE. LYDIA MEANS SO MUCH
TO US, HONESTLY, THAT YOU'VE
TRUSTED AWS TO. TO HELP DELIVER
ALL THESE CAPABILITIES. THESE
BREAKTHROUGHS THAT ARE CHANGING
PEOPLE'S LIVES. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. AND THANK YOU, ADAM AWS
HAS JUST BEEN AN AMAZING
PARTNER. THANK YOU. WE LOOK
FORWARD TO MORE. THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. SO
ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE
ARE USING AWS FOR AGILITY FOR
SPEED AND FOR THE SCALE THAT
THEY NEED TO DRIVE THEIR
FUTURES. BUT THIS REQUIRES
EMPLOYEES WITH TOP NOTCH CLOUD
SKILLS. AND WE KNOW THAT NOT
ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE THAT CLOUD
EXPERTISE AND THAT THERE'S A
LARGE SKILL GAP THAT'S GOT TO BE
CLOSED. SO GENERATIVE AI IS OF
COURSE, THE NEXT INCREDIBLY
EXCITING NEW OPPORTUNITY. BUT
IT'S ONLY GOING TO ADD TO THAT
GAP. AND SO WE'RE INVESTING TO
HELP PROVIDE THE CLOUD SCALE
SKILLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
NEEDED ACROSS THE WORLD FOR
YEARS TO COME. AWS IS COMMITTED
TO TRAINING 29 MILLION PEOPLE
FOR FREE WITH CLOUD COMPUTING
SKILLS BY THE YEAR 2025. AND
WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 21
MILLION ALREADY TRAINED. AND WE
JUST LAUNCHED WE JUST RECENTLY
LAUNCHED THE AWS CLOUD
INSTITUTE, WHICH IS PROVIDING
DEEP CLOUD EXPERTISE TO HELP
STUDENTS LAUNCH AN ENTIRE CLOUD
CAREER. AND WE'VE ALSO LAUNCHED
100 DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING
AND AI COURSES AND RESOURCES TO
SUPPORT INNOVATION AND JUST OVER
A WEEK AGO, WE ANNOUNCED AI
READY, WHICH IS OUR NEW
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE FREE AI
SKILLS TO ANOTHER 2 MILLION
PEOPLE BY 2025 AND TO HELP
STUDENTS AROUND THE WORLD WITH
TO LEARN THE FOUNDATION SKILLS
AND TO PREPARE FOR A CAREER IN
TECH. WE ACTUALLY CREATED AN AI
AND MACHINE LEARNING SCHOLARSHIP
FUND. LET'S MEET SOME OF THE
RECIPIENT. THIS. MY NAME IS
VANIA GAREWAL. MY NAME IS JOSE
TAPIA. MY NAME IS OLYMPIA
OTIENO. WITHOUT THE AI/ML
SCHOLARSHIP, I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP MY OWN
QUESTIONS. KNOW WHAT TOOLS ARE
AVAILABLE TO SOLVE THEM. THE
NANODEGREE IS DEFINITELY
UNLOCKED. MY INTEREST IN AI
CONSTANTLY TRY TO GO OUT THERE
AND TALK TO GIRLS WHO ARE
CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN
LIFE IN KENYA DUE TO CROP
DISEASE WIZ THE RATES AT WHICH
THE YIELDS HAVE BEEN DROPPING IS
DEVASTATING. SO MY COLLEAGUES
AND I HAVE MADE A MOBILE
APPLICATION WITH AI FARMERS
PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE CROP
DISEASES. THE FACT THAT I WAS
ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM,
I NOW KNOW THAT I AM CAPABLE OF
DOING WELL IN THIS FIELD. I
MEAN, THIS IS WHY WE DO THIS
STUFF, RIGHT? WHAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE
JOSE AND OLYMPIA HERE WITH US
TODAY. SO COME ON, LET'S GIVE
THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THERE
WE GO. TO BOTH OF YOU. I'M SO
PROUD. I'M REALLY PROUD OF WHAT
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE. AND I JUST
REALLY HOPE THAT REINVENT THIS
WEEK IS JUST A GREAT, GREAT
EXPERIENCE FOR YOU. THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR LETTING US SHARE YOUR
STORIES AND FOR EVERYONE
WATCHING, WE WANT TO EMPOWER ALL
OF YOU TO BUILD AND TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF IMPACT. AND WE SEE A
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THAT BY
INFUSING GENERATIVE AI INTO ALL
OF THE SYSTEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE
USING INTO THEIR DAILY LIVES. WE
BELIEVE THAT GENERATIVE AI
SHOULD HELP EVERYONE AT WORK
SEAMLESSLY WITH HELPFUL,
RELEVANT ASSISTANCE. WHETHER OR
NOT, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST THING
ABOUT FOUNDATION MODELS IS RAG
OR ANY OF THE REST. AND THAT
BRINGS US TO THE TOP OF THE
STACK, THE APPLICATIONS THAT YOU
USE THAT ARE POWERED BY
GENERATIVE AI, LEVERAGING
FOUNDATION MODELS. WE BELIEVE
THAT GENERATIVE AI, OF COURSE,
HAS THE POTENTIAL OVER TIME TO
TRANSFORM VIRTUALLY EVERY
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THAT WE
KNOW. IT CAN POUR THROUGH THE
NOOKS AND CRANNIES OF A SYSTEM
AND ACTUALLY HELP YOU FIND DATA
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
EXISTED. AND THEN HELP YOU PUT
IT TO OPTIMAL USE. IT CAN
GENERATE INSIGHTS THAT CAN SAVE
HOURS OF MANUAL WORK AND IT CAN
TAKE PROJECTS THAT WERE SLOGS
AND MAKE THEM A SNAP. NOW, ONE
IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS HOW
GENERATIVE AI CAN MAKE THE TASK
OF WRITING CODE RADICALLY
FASTER. AND SO LAST YEAR WE
RELEASED AMAZON CODEWHISPERER,
WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD GENERATIVE
AI, WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD
APPLICATIONS, I SHOULD SAY,
FASTER AND MORE SECURELY BY
GENERATING CODE SUGGESTIONS IN
NEAR REAL TIME. NOW WITH
CODEWHISPERER DEVELOPERS USE A
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPT AND THEN
RECEIVE ACCURATE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN EVERY POPULAR IDE
. AND FOR 15 OF THE MOST POPULAR
PROGRAMING LANGUAGES, A
CODEWHISPERER GIVES DEVELOPERS A
POWERFUL BOOST FOR GENERAL CODE
EXAMPLES. AND OF COURSE WE MADE
SURE THAT IT'S GREAT FOR
PROVIDING SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS
FOR CODE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
WARNER MUSIC GROUP, THE
BUNDESLIGA AND THE CIGNA GROUP
HAVE EMBRACED CODEWHISPERER TO
ACCELERATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT
CAPABILITIES, AND TATA
CONSULTANCY SERVICES, AWS,
ACCENTURE AND HCLTECH ARE MAKING
CODEWHISPERER AVAILABLE TO TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES EACH.
NOW COHEN IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN
THE ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR
INDUSTRY. THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT CODEWHISPERER IS A GAME
CHANGER FOR THEM AND WE WANT AS
MANY DEVELOPERS AS POSSIBLE TO
REAP THE BENEFITS. AND SO WHAT
WE'VE DONE IS TO MAKE CODE
WHISPERER, TO MAKE THE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN IT FREE, FREE FOR
INDIVIDUAL USE. NOW THE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CODE
WHISPERS ARE GREAT FOR GENERAL
CODING TASKS, BUT GENERAL CODING
SUGGESTIONS CAN ONLY GET YOUR
DEVELOPERS SO FAR. IMAGINE
YOU'VE JUST HIRED A NEW
DEVELOPER FOR EVEN IF THEY ARE
WORLD CLASS, THEY ARE NOT GOING
TO DO THEIR BEST WORK UNTIL THEY
UNDERSTAND YOUR CODE BASE AND
YOUR INTERNAL BEST PRACTICES. AN
AI POWERED CODING TOOLS ARE
SIMILAR. YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT
TOOL, BUT FOR THE KIND OF SPEED
AND RELEVANCY THAT MAKES THE
MOST DIFFERENCE, YOUR SOLUTION
HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF
YOUR CODE AND THE BEST PLACE TO
FIND THAT CONTEXT IS INSIDE OF
YOUR INTERNAL APIS, YOUR
LIBRARIES AND YOUR PACKAGES.
THAT'S WHY A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AGO WE PREVIEWED A CAPABILITY
THAT ALLOWS CODEWHISPERER TO
SECURELY LEARN FROM YOUR
INTERNAL CODE BASE TO PROVIDE
MUCH, MUCH MORE PERTINENT,
CUSTOMIZED AND USEFUL CODE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS. CODEWHISPERER IS
AN EXPERT ON YOUR CODE AND CAN
PROVIDE MUCH MORE TAILORED
SUGGESTIONS. CREATING AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR INTERNAL
SDKS, YOUR APIS, YOUR LANGUAGES
AND YOUR CLASSES. AND OF COURSE
ANY CUSTOMIZATIONS ARE ISOLATE
AND WE NEVER USE CUSTOMERS
CONTENT FROM CODEWHISPERER TO
TRAIN ANY OF OUR UNDERLYING
MODELS. NOW TO UNDERSTAND THE
IMPACT OF THIS KIND OF
CUSTOMIZATION, WE WORKED WITH
PERSISTENT A DIGITAL ENGINEERING
PROVIDER. NOW
THEIR STUDIES SHOWED THAT
DEVELOPERS USING CODEWHISPERER
COMPLETED THEIR TASKS AN
ADDITIONAL 28% FASTER WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS THAN WITHOUT 28.
AND AWS IS THE ONLY MAJOR CLOUD
PROVIDER THAT'S CURRENTLY
AUTHORIZING OFFERING A
CUSTOMIZED CAPABILITY THAT
ANYONE CAN SIGN UP FOR AND USE
TODAY. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT CODEWHISPERER ABOUT
CODEWHISPERER CUSTOMIZATIONS AND
HOW IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU
ACCELERATE YOUR WORK AND
INCREASE YOUR IMPACT. BUT WE'RE
JUST GETTING STARTED AND WE SEE
A LOT MORE POTENTIAL USES WITH
GENERATIVE AI. FOR EXAMPLE,
THINK ABOUT GENERATIVE AI CHAT
APPLICATIONS. SO THESE DAYS IT
SEEMS LIKE JUST ABOUT EVERYONE
IS EXPERIMENTING WITH THEM,
RIGHT? AND WHAT THE EARLY
PROVIDERS IN THIS SPACE HAVE
DONE IS REALLY EXCITING AND IT'S
GENUINELY SUPER USEFUL FOR
CONSUMER OWNERS. BUT IN A LOT OF
WAYS, THESE APPLICATIONS DON'T
REALLY WORK AT WORK. THEY'RE
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR
CAPABILITIES ARE GREAT, BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR COMPANY. THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR DATA, YOUR
CUSTOMERS OR YOUR OPERATIONS.
AND THIS LIMITS HOW HOW USEFUL
THEIR SUGGESTIONS CAN BE. THEY
ALSO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHO
YOU ARE AT WORK. THEY DON'T KNOW
YOUR ROLE, YOUR PREFERENCES,
WHAT INFORMATION YOU USE AND
WHAT YOU DO, AND DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO. SO CRITICALLY. OTHER
PROVIDERS WHO HAVE LAUNCHED
TOOLS, THEY'VE LAUNCHED THEM
WITHOUT DATA PRIVACY AND
SECURITY CAPABILITIES. THE
VIRTUE ALI EVERY ENTERPRISE
REQUIRES. AND SO MANY CIOS
ACTUALLY BANNED THE USE OF A LOT
OF THESE MOST POPULAR CHAT
ASSISTANTS INSIDE THEIR
ORGANIZATIONS. AND THIS HAS BEEN
WELL PUBLICIZED AND JUST ASK ANY
CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY
OFFICER OR CSO AND THEY'LL TELL
YOU YOU CAN'T REALLY BOLT ON
SECURITY AFTER THE FACT. AND
EXPECT IT TO WORK AS WELL. IT'S
MUCH, MUCH BETTER TO BUILD
SECURITY INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL
DESIGN OF THE TECHNOLOGY. SO
WHEN WE SET OUT TO BUILD
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS, WE
KNEW WE HAD TO ADDRESS THESE
GAPS, HAD TO BE BUILT IN FROM
THE VERY START. RIGHT? AND
THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M REALLY
PROUD AND EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
AMAZON MQ A NEW TYPE OF
GENERATIVE AI POWERED ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO WORK FOR YOU AT WORK
. Q LETS YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS
QUICKLY WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE
INTERACTIONS, YOU CAN EASILY
CHAT, GENERATE CONTENT, TAKE
ACTIONS, AND IT'S ALL INFORMED
BY AN UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA REPOSITOR WIZ
YOUR OPERATIONS. AND OF COURSE
WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT ROCK SOLID
SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARE. SO Q
UNDERSTANDS AND RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING IDENTITIES, YOUR ROLES
AND YOUR PERMISSIONS. IF A USER
DOES NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO
ACCESS SOMETHING WITHOUT Q, THEY
CANNOT ACCESS IT WITH Q EITHER.
AND WE'VE DESIGNED Q TO MEET
ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS AND
ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS STRINGENT
REQUIREMENTS FROM DAY ONE. AND
WE NEVER WANT BUSINESS CUSTOMERS
CONTENT. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
USE THAT CONTENT FOR. Q TO TRAIN
UNDERLYING MODELS. I REALLY
BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO BE
TRANSFORMATIVE. WE WANT LOTS OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO DO
LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
TO BENEFIT FROM AMAZON. Q NOW,
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. WE WANT Q
TO HELP DEVELOPERS AND BUILDERS
BE MORE EFFICIENT, MORE
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND MORE
PROFICIENT. SO FOR STARTERS,
AMAZON Q IS YOUR EXPERT
ASSISTANT FOR BUILDING ON AWS
NOW TO SUPERCHARGE WORK FOR
DEVELOPERS AND IT PROS? WE'VE
TRAINED AMAZON Q ON 17 YEARS
WORTH OF KNOWLEDGE SO IT CAN
TRANSFORM THE WAY YOU THINK,
OPTIMIZE AND OPERATE
APPLICATIONS AND WORKLOADS ON
AWS AND WE'VE PUT AMAZON. Q
WHERE YOU WORK, SO IT'S READY TO
ASSIST YOU IN THE AWS MANAGEMENT
CONSOLE AND DOCUMENTATION CHAN
IN YOUR IDP VIA CODEWHISPERER
AND IN YOUR TEAM CHAT ROOMS LIKE
SLACK, YOU CAN CHAT WITH AWS
CLOUD TO EXPLORE AWS
CAPABILITIES, LEARN UNFAMILIAR
TECHNOLOGIES, ARCHITECT
SOLUTIONS. ITS AN EXPERT IN AWS
WELL-ARCHITECTED PATTERNS LEARNS
BEST PRACTICES AND SOLUTION
IMPLEMENTATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK AMAZON Q HOW DO I
BUILD A WEB APPLICATION WITH
AWS? WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? IT'S
GOING TO ANSWER WITH A LIST OF
POTENTIAL SERVICES THAT YOU
COULD USE, SUCH AS AMPLIFY,
LAMBDA OR EC2, AND THEN IT'S
GOING TO OFFER REASONS WHY YOU
MIGHT CONSIDER EACH SERVICE.
FROM THERE YOU CAN FURTHER
NARROW DOWN YOUR OPTIONS THROUGH
NATURAL LANGUAGE, LIKE WHICH OF
THESE WOULD BE PREFERRED? IF MY
APP IS ONLY NEEDS TO RUN FOR A
FEW SECONDS AND ONLY HAS VERY
INFREQUENT TRAFFIC LAMBDA AMAZON
Q IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR
REQUIREMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION
AND IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE YOU
WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ONCE YOU'VE
CHOSEN A SERVICE, YOU CAN ASK
AMAZON. Q HOW DO I GET STARTED?
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU STEP
BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR
CONFIGURING THE SOLUTION PLUS
LINKS TO RELEVANT INFORMATION TO
DOCUMENT STATION AND SO ON. AND
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF
HOW AMAZON Q IS GOING TO HELP
YOU WITH YOUR WORK. FOR EXAMPLE,
IF YOU ENCOUNTER AN ERROR WITH
LAMBDA IN THE CONSOLE, YOU JUST
PRESS THE TROUBLESHOOT ROUTE
WITH AMAZON Q BUTTON, AND Q IS
GOING TO RESEARCH THE ERROR, AND
IT'S GOING TO SUGGEST HOW TO FIX
IT. AMAZON. Q CAN ALSO
TROUBLESHOOT YOUR NETWORK
CONNECTIONS AND IT CAN ANALYZE
YOUR END TO END NETWORK
CONFIGURATION AND HELP RESOLVE
OF CONNECTIVITY ISSUES QUICKLY.
THAT IS A HUGE TIME SAVER. NOW
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU HELP US WITH?
HOW ABOUT CHOOSING THE OPTIMAL
EC2 INSTANCE SO YOU CAN JUST
TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR WORKLOAD AND
GET AN ACCURATE, QUICK AND
ECONOMICAL INSTANCE TYPE
RECOMMENDATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
WHICH EC2 INSTANCE TYPES PROVIDE
THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE FOR
VIDEO ENCODING AND TRANSCODING
WORKLOADS SUPPORTING GAMING USE
CASES AND YOU GET YOUR
RECOMMENDATION. IT'S THAT EASY.
THIS IS ALL VERY COOL AND WE
EXPECT THAT AMAZON Q IS GOING TO
SAVE CUSTOMERS SO MUCH TIME IN
ARCHITECTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
AND OPTIMIZING YOUR WORKLOADS.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL THE Q CAN DO
FOR YOU. AMAZON Q IS ALSO GOING
TO BE IN THE IDP FOR DEVELOPERS.
IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE
CODE IN THE IDE OR YOU NEED TO
DIG IN INTO HOW A SPECIFIC
FUNCTION WORKS, AMAZON, Q AND
CODEWHISPERER IS GOING TO HELP
YOU GET UP TO SPEED BY USING ITS
DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF AWS AND ITS
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR CODE BASES
. SO YOU NEED TO ADD TESTS. JUST
ASK Q AND IT'S GOING TO
AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE THE TEST
FOR YOU. AND THIS IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
DEVELOPERS. BUT WE KNEW WE COULD
DO EVEN MORE TO HELP YOU BUILD
EVEN FASTER. FOR EXAMPLE, THINK
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO
BUILDING A NEW FEATURE. YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENTS.
THINK THROUGH DESIGN, WRITE ALL
THE CODE, ADD TESTS, DOCUMENT
THE CODE AND SO ON, AND A FILE
COULD SPAN HUNDREDS TO EVEN
THOUSANDS OF LINES OF CODE. AND
THIS IS A DAUNTING TASK. IF
YOU'RE USING AMAZON
CODEWHISPERER IT'S GOING TO
GENERATE CHUNKS OF NEW CODE FOR
YOU, WHICH IS A REAL TIME SAVER
THAT STILL LEAVES ALL THE REST.
SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR
AMAZON. Q SPECIFICALLY, Q'S
FEATURE DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY,
WHICH IS GOING TO AUTOMATE THE
MULTI STEP DEVELOPMENT TASK OF
ADDING NEW FEATURES TO YOUR
APPLICATION. SO INSTEAD OF ALL
THAT WORK NOW YOU JUST WRITE A
PROMPT AND Q IS GOING TO USE ITS
EXPERTISE ENRICHED WITH AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR PROJECT
CODE, AND IT'S GOING TO DO ALL
THE HEAVY LIFTING FOR YOU. SO
AMAZON Q WILL CREATE THE DRAFT
PLAN, WHICH YOU CAN THEN
COLLABORATE AND ITERATIVELY
IMPROVE USING NATURAL LANGUAGE
CHAT UNTIL IT'S POLISHED AND
READY TO GO. AND THEN Q REALLY
KICKS INTO GEAR. IT'S GOING TO
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN ACROSS YOUR
FILES IN YOUR APPLICATION. AN
AND YOU REMAIN IN CONTROL USING
YOUR EXPERTISE TO REVIEW CHANGES
AND ENSURE THE VERY BEST
QUALITY. SO THIS IS HOURS OF
WORK THAT Q CAN DO FOR YOU WITH
JUST ONE GOOD PROMPT. AND THIS
FEATURE IS AVAILABLE TODAY IN
AMAZON CODE CATALYST AND WILL
SOON BE FULLY AVAILABLE IN THE
IDE. YOU WILL NOT CURRENTLY FIND
AN AI ASSISTANT FROM ANOTHER
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER THAT CAN DO
THIS FOR YOU TODAY. BUT WE'RE
NOT DONE YET. LET'S KEEP GOING.
WE KNOW THAT DEVELOPERS SPEND A
LOT OF TIME SLOGGING THROUGH THE
MUCK THAT COMES WITH MAINTENANCE
AND UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE AND
UPGRADES. BIG DEAL, RIGHT? SO
TAKE TAKE LANGUAGE VERSION
UPGRADES, FOR EXAMPLE. HOW MANY
OF YOU ARE USING OLDER VERSIONS
OF JAVA? BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO
TAKE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS TO
UPGRADE HANDS? OH YEAH. A LOT OF
THEM. SO MIGRATIONS ARE
INEVITABLY COME WITH A LOT OF
NUANCE AND EDGE CASES. AND SO
YOU END UP SPENDING A TON OF
TIME WRITING AND REWRITING THE
CODE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND
TRYING TO GET IT COMPILE TO
COMPILE AND WORK. AND SOMETIMES
THESE PROGRAMS TAKE SO LONG THAT
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE IN A
MIGRATION INFINITY LOOP. JUST AS
ONE ENDS, THE NEXT BEGINS. AND
IT'S NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE
TEMPTATION TO JUST MAINTAIN
STATUS QUO. BUT DOING THAT MEANS
THAT YOU MISS OUT ON PERFORMANCE
IMPROVEMENTS AND IT MEANS MUCH
WORSE THAT IT CAN ALSO OPEN YOU
UP TO POTENTIAL SECURITY
VULNERABILITIES. AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT INTO AMAZON. Q CODE
TRANSFORMATION, WHICH HELPS YOU
WITH UPGRADES TO TRANSFORM CODE
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME THAT
IT TAKES TODAY. ALL THE
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO ALL A
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO IS ASK YOU
TO PERFORM THE CODE
TRANSFORMATION AND IT HANDLES
THE REST FROM IDENTIFYING AND
UPGRADING AND MANDATORY CODE
PACKAGE DEPOSITORIES AND
FRAMEWORKS TO REPLACING
DEPRECATED CODE AND
INCORPORATING SECURITY BEST
PRACTICES. CUZ EVEN GOING TO RUN
TESTS ON THE UPGRADED
APPLICATION VERSION. SO WE'VE
BEEN USING THIS, THIS
APPLICATION, THIS THIS
CAPABILITY INTERNALLY AND THE
RESULTS ARE STUNNING. SO WITH
AMAZON Q TRANSFORMATION IN A
VERY SMALL TEAM OF AMAZON
DEVELOPERS SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADED
1000 APPLICATIONS FROM JAVA
EIGHT TO JAVA 17 IN JUST TWO
DAYS. NOW I'M GOING TO SAY THAT
AGAIN, 1000 APPLICATION UPGRADES
IN TWO DAYS. THAT'S HOW LONG A
SINGLE APPLICATION UPGRADE USED
TO TAKE. I MEAN, THIS IS MONTHS,
MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS OF
DEVELOPER TIME SAVED A LOT OF
VERY HAPPY PEOPLE AT AMAZON OVER
THIS. I PROMISE YOU. SO TODAY,
AMAZON. Q CAN WORK ITS MAGIC ON
JAVA UPGRADES, BUT SOON YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT TO
HELP MIGRATE YOUR NETWORK LOADS
FROM WINDOWS TO LINUX. AND THERE
ARE A LOT OF APPLICATIONS OUT
THERE STUCK ON WINDOWS BECAUSE
OF THE SHEER EFFORT REQUIRED IN
MAKING THE MIGRATION. AND THIS
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HUGE COST
SAVINGS ON COSTLY LICENSING FEES
ON TOP OF THE INHERENT
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY
BENEFITS. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE
OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION? ALL THE FOLKS IN
MARKETING, FINANCE, HR, PRODUCT
MANAGEMENT AND MORE? THERE'S SO
MUCH INFORMATION SPREAD ACROSS
YOUR ORGANIZATION'S DOCUMENTS,
VASS ALL OF YOUR DATA, ALL OF
YOUR APPLICATIONS, ASIANS AND
PEOPLE IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
ROLES, THEY STRUGGLE EVERY DAY
TO FIND THE INFORMATION THAT
THEY NEED TO AND THEN TRANSFORM
IT INTO MAKING DECISIONS AND
TAKING ACTIONS AND DOING THAT
FAST ENOUGH TO STAY COMPETITIVE,
OF FINDING RELEVANT INFORMATION,
MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS, TAKING
ACTION THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR,
RIGHT? YEP AMAZON. Q IS ALSO
YOUR BUSINESS EXPERT. Q HAS
CONNECTIONS TO OVER 40 POPULAR
ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS, SO EMPLOYEES
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION CAN ASK
COMPLEX QUESTIONS AND GET
DETAILED, ACCURATE, NUANCED
ANSWERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO
THEIR ROLE AT WORK. AND AGAIN,
SECURE IS SECURE AND Q IS SECURE
AND PRIVATE. IT RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING ROLES AND THE
PERMISSIONS THAT ARE GRANTED
UNIQUELY TO EACH USER. WE'RE
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, AND I
ACTUALLY WANTED TO SHOW YOU JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF AMAZON. Q AND
FOR YOUR BUSINESS IN ACTION. SO
TO PUT THROUGH Q PUT Q THROUGH
ITS PACES. PLEASE WELCOME AWS
OWN DR. MATT WOOD TO THE STAGE.
THANKS, ADAM, AND GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE. I'M EXCITED TO GIVE
YOU A FIRST LOOK AT AMAZON. Q A
NEW TYPE OF AI ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO BE AN EXPERT IN YOUR
BUSINESS WITH AMAZON. Q YOU CAN
GET QUICK, ACCURATE, RELEVANT
ANSWERS TO YOUR MOST PRESSING
BUSINESS QUESTIONS, ALL
DELIVERED SECURELY AND
PRIVATELY. GETTING STARTED WITH
Q IS SIMPLE AND TAKES JUST THREE
STEPS. FIRST, YOU CONFIGURE
AMAZON Q BY CONNECTING AND
CUSTOMIZING Q WITH DETAILS OF
YOUR OWN ORGANIZATION. THEN Q
CONNECTS TO EXISTING DATA
SOURCES LIKE S3 SALESFORCE,
MICROSOFT, GOOGLE SLACK AND MORE
SUPPORTING OVER 40 POPULAR
BUSINESS APPLICATIONS AND
SERVICES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.
ONCE CONNECTED AMAZON Q STARTS
INDEXING ALL OF YOUR DATA AND
CONTENT, LEARNING EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR
BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES
UNDERSTANDING THE CORE CONCEPT
PRODUCT NAMES, ORGANIZATION,
STRUCTURE, ALL THE DETAILS THAT
MAKE YOUR BUSINESS UNIQUE, AS
WELL AS INDEXING THE DATA FROM
THESE SOURCES. Q ALSO USES
GENERATIVE AI TO UNDERSTAND AND
CAPTURE THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION
WHICH MAKES YOUR BUSINESS
UNIQUE. THIS ADDITIONAL SEMANTIC
INFORMATION IS CAPTURED AS
VECTOR EMBEDDINGS, ALLOWING Q TO
PROVIDE HIGHLY RELEVANT RESULTS
WHICH ARE TAILORED TO YOUR
SPECIFIC COMPANY AND INDUSTRY.
YOUR DATA REMAINS COMPLETELY
UNDER YOUR CONTROL AT ALL TIMES.
AMAZON Q NEVER SHARES IT
EXTERNALLY OR USES IT TO IMPROVE
ANY OF THE UNDERLYING MODELS,
AND THAT'S IT. SURPRISE. THERE
IS NO STEP THREE. JUST OPEN
AMAZON Q IN YOUR BROWSER AND
AWAY YOU GO WITH A FULLY
CUSTOMIZED, SECURE ASSISTANT WHO
IS AN EXPERT IN YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU COMMUNICATE WITH Q THROUGH
THIS FRIENDLY WEB APPLICATION
DESIGNED FOR EVERYONE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION TO USE. Q KNOWS WHO
YOU ARE AND ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY
AND ROLE. AND BECAUSE Q
UNDERSTANDS YOUR BUSINESS
SEMANTICS, YOU CAN ASK FAR MORE
DETAILED AND NUANCED QUESTIONS
AND GET TAILORED ANSWERS FASTER
THAN EVER BEFORE FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK Q TO ANALYZE WHICH
PRODUCT FEATURES CUSTOMERS ARE
STRUGGLING WITH AND RECOMMEND
WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM AS SOON AS
YOU HIT ENTER. Q GETS TO WORK ON
UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION AND
PREPARING AN ANSWER. Q STARTS BY
CREATING A SET OF INPUT PROMPTS.
AUTOMATIC ALI. Q THEN USES ALL
OF THE BUSINESS CONTEXT
AVAILABLE TO FIND RELEVANT DATA,
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS AND
PICKS THE BEST ONES BEFORE
COMBINING EVERYTHING TOGETHER
INTO A RESPONSE, ALL IN JUST A
FRACTION OF A SECOND, USING THE
POWER OF GENERATIVE AI AMAZON Q
REMAINS FAITHFUL TO YOUR
ORIGINAL SOURCES, CITING THEM IN
LINE SO THAT YOU CAN VALIDATE
THE INFORMATION EASILY. Q'S
EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE MAGICAL, BUT
THERE IS NO MAGICAL BLACK BOX
JUST GIVING YOU ANSWERS. YOU CAN
UPLOAD NEW WORD DOCUMENTS TO
CSVS AND OTHER FILES ON THE FLY.
GO TO Q TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS
RESPONSES, LETTING YOU ASK
QUESTIONS ABOUT AD HOC DATA
WHICH HASN'T YET BEEN ADDED TO
ANY CORPORATE SYSTEM. AND AMAZON
Q WAS BUILT WITH PRIVACY AND
SECURITY IN MIND FROM THE GROUND
UP. SO EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SEEK
INFORMATION TO WHICH WE DON'T
HAVE ACCESS, AMAZON Q RESPECTS
YOUR EXISTING ACCESS CONTROLS
ONLY RETURNING INFORMATION
YOU'RE AUTHORIZED TO SEE. ADMINS
CAN ALSO RESTRICT SENSITIVE
TOPICS FILTERING OUT
INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS AND
ANSWERS WHERE NECESSARY. FINALLY
AMAZON Q CAN TAKE ACTIONS ON
YOUR BEHALF THROUGH A SET OF
CONFIGURABLE PLUGINS? AS AN
EXAMPLE, IF YOU UPDATE, SAY,
YOUR TRAINING PRIORITIES, Q CAN
AUTOMATICALLY CREATE TICKETS IN
JIRA. NOTIFY LEADERS IN SLACK
AND UPDATE DASHBOARDS IN
SERVICENOW. Q ALLOWS YOU TO
INSPECT ACTIONS BEFORE THEY RUN
SO YOU CAN REVIEW THEM AND ADD
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND
AFTER THE ACTION RUNS, Q WILL
LINK TO THE RESULTS FOR
VERIFICATION. SO IN SUMMARY,
AMAZON Q BRINGS AI ASSISTANT
INTO THE BUSINESS WORLD,
PROVIDING SECURE TO RELEVANT AND
ACTIONABLE GUIDANCE TAILORED
ENTIRELY TO YOUR COMPANY. WE
CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO TRY. Q AND
SEE HOW IT WILL HELP YOUR
ORGANIZATION WITH THAT. BACK TO
ADAM. THANKS A LOT. THAT WAS
AWESOME. AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
BUSINESSES. EMPLOYEES ARE GOING
TO LOVE AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS AND DISCOVER
AND SYNTHESIZE NEW INFORMATION
AND LIFT FOLKS OUT OF MONOTONOUS
DRAG OF REPETITIVE TASKS. AND IT
IS GOING TO LOVE HOW ALL OF THIS
COMES WITH RIGOROUS SECURITY AND
PRIVACY. NOW, I KNOW AT LEAST A
FEW OF YOU OUT THERE ARE
WONDERING IF AMAZON Q CAN ACCESS
MY DATA? DOES THAT MEAN IT CAN
HELP WITH MY BUSINESS
INTELLIGENCE? YES. AND OF COURSE
THE ANDREW NG ANSWER IS A
RESOUNDING YES. SO WE'VE BEEN
WORKING FOR A WHILE TO MAKE
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE MORE
ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WITHOUT BI
EXPERTISE. WE THINK ANYONE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS
OF THEIR DATA USING NATURAL
LANGUAGE AND SO AMAZON
QUICKSIGHT OUR ML POWER BI
SERVICE NOW HAS AMAZON Q
FEATURES BUILT IN FIRST AMAZON Q
IS GOING TO HELP REDUCE THE TIME
THAT IT TAKES BUSINESS ANALYSTS
TO CREATE DASHBOARDS AND REPORTS
FROM HOURS DOWN TO MINUTES BY
LETTING THEM SIMPLY TELL AMAZON
Q WHAT THEY WANT TO VISUALIZE.
FOR EXAMPLE, REGIONAL SALES BY
PRODUCT IS A SANKEY DIAGRAM. Q
COMES RIGHT BACK WITH THAT
DIAGRAM. UM, AND YOU CAN ADD IT
TO YOUR DASHBOARD WITH EASE AND
YOU CAN TELL. Q TO FURTHER
REFINE THE VISUAL, SAY YOU WANT
TO CHANGE THE CHART TO A
VERTICAL STACKED BAR CHART BY
MONTH AND COLOR CODED BY REGION.
YOUR WISH IS Q'S COMMAND. WITH
Q, YOU CAN GET BETTER DASHBOARDS
FASTER, BUT EVEN THE BEST
DASHBOARDS DON'T TELL EVERY
ANGLE OF THE STORY. FOR, FOR
EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ASK AMAZON. Q
WHERE DID WE HAVE THE HIGHEST
SALES? AND YOU GET A GET A
RESPONSE CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR
BUSINESS DATA. YOU CAN ASK A
FOLLOW UP QUESTION EVEN AS
LITTLE AS ONE WORD LIKE LONDON.
AND BECAUSE Q MAINTAINS THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR CURRENT
CONVERSATIONS, YOU CAN GET
INSIGHTS FROM YOUR DATA QUICKLY.
ORI NOW ENABLING PEOPLE TO TALK
TO Q AND QUICKSIGHT IS A BIG
STEP FORWARD IN HELPING YOUR
ORGANIZATION BE EVEN MORE DATA
DRIVEN. BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
GETTING HANDS ON WITH DATA. A
LOT OF PEOPLE CONSUME DATA
THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AND
REPORTS, AND SO, SO MUCH OF YOU
DO AT WORK IS TELLING STORIES
WITH DATA. AND AS YOUR BUSINESS
EXPERT, Q IS HERE TO MAKE THAT
EASIER TOO. LET'S SAY YOU WANT
TO CREATE A MONTHLY REPORT ON
YOUR BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA.
YOU CAN ASK YOU TO WRITE A
MONTHLY REPORT ABOUT THE
BUSINESS AND MAKE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT MONTH.
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU
VISUALIZATION OPTIONS. YOU
CHOOSE THE ONES YOU WANT, AND
THEN Q WILL FORMAT THEM. AND IN
SECONDS YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL AND
COMPELLING STORY AND IT'S
COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE. YOU CAN
ACTUALLY ADD MORE CONTEXT TO THE
SECTION BY ASKING YOU TO ADD A
VISUAL OF THE USAGE TREND, AND Q
WILL GENERATE A SHORT SUMMARY.
AND THEN YOU CAN FURTHER TWEAK
IT BY MAKING IT LONGER, SHORTER
OR REFORMATTING IT TO BULLETS.
LET'S MAKE IT LONGER. ONCE WE'RE
HAPPY WITH THE STORY, WE CAN
SECURELY SHARE IT WITH OTHERS.
WITH AMAZON Q AND QUICKSIGHT YOU
NOW HAVE AN EXPERT BI ASSISTANT
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR BUSINESS ANALYSTS AND IT'S
GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR END
USERS TO GET ANSWERS TO AND
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND THESE NEW Q
CAPABILITIES AND QUICKSIGHT ARE
AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW TODAY. NOW,
A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE
TARGETED TO HORIZONTAL USE CASES
OR SPECIFIC LINES OF BUSINESS
AND AWS HAS APPLICATIONS IN
THESE AREAS TOO. SO OUR FIRST
SPECIALIZED LINE OF BUSINESS
SOLUTION WAS AMAZON CONNECT. SO
IT'S BORN IN THE CLOUD AND OF
COURSE, AMAZON CONNECT IS A
SCALABLE COST EFFECTIVE, EASY TO
USE. CONTACT CENTER APPLICATION
THAT'S REINVENTED CUSTOMER
SERVICE GENERATIVE AI THAT KNOWS
YOUR BUSINESS IS GOING TO HAVE
AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON THE
WHOLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
EXPERIENCE ACROSS SO MANY
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. YOUR
CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAMS ARE AT
THE HEART OF YOUR BUSINESSES
DELIVERING INTERACTIONS THAT
PEOPLE REMEMBER FOR GOOD AND FOR
BAD. SO GETTING THIS RIGHT
REALLY MATTERS IS TODAY CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS SPEND A LOT OF
TIME GATHERING INFORMATION FROM
CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR
QUESTIONS AND THEN THEY SPEND
EVEN MORE TIME SEARCHING FOR THE
RIGHT ANSWER. NOW CONNECT HAS
MADE THIS A LOT EASIER ALREADY
WITH MACHINE LEARNING
TRANSCRIPTION ANALYTICS, BUT WE
KNEW WE COULD MAKE IT EVEN
BETTER FOR YOUR AGENTS AND
CERTAINLY FOR THE CUSTOMERS
WAITING ON THE OTHER END OF THE
LINE FOR HELP. ENTER AMAZON Q
AND CONNECT AVAILABLE TODAY AND
THIS IS GOING TO GIVE CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS A MAJOR ASSIST
AGENTS CAN CHAT WITH. Q DIRECTLY
INSIDE OF AMAZON CONNECT TO HELP
THEM RESPOND QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS. LIVE CHAT WITH Q WITH
FAST ANSWERS IS GREAT, BUT WHAT
IF YOU COULD MAKE THE CALL
ITSELF THE PROMPT NOW INSIDE OF
CONNECT? Q IS ACTUALLY THERE ON
THE CALLS ASSISTING WITH
PROPOSED RESPONSES WITH
SUGGESTED ACTIONS, WITH LINKS TO
RELEVANT ARTICLES? NO TYPING
REQUIRED, SO CONTACT CENTERS,
SUPERVISORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
ARE ALSO GOING TO GET A
GENERATIVE AI BOOST CONNECT NOW
AUTOMATICALLY CREATES POST CALL
SUMMARIES THAT SUPERVISORS CAN
USE TO TRACK FOLLOW UP ACTIONS
AND TO UNCOVER AGENT COACHING
OPPORTUNITIES. AND FOR
ADMINISTRATORS, CONNECT CAN SET
UP CHAT BOTS AND INTERACTIVE
VOICE RESPONSES THROUGH SIMPLE
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPTS.
STREAMLINE LEARNING THE PROCESS.

HIGH BAR THAT GIVES YOU BROAD
AND DEEP CAPABILITIES, CHOICE
AND ENTERPRISE READINESS. BUT
IT'S SO EARLY IN THE GAME AND
WE'RE INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
DO TOGETHER. NOW, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING THAT CUSTOMERS ARE
GOING TO NEED FOR ANY OF THIS TO
WORK, AND THAT'S DATA. YOUR
DATA. NO ONE ELSE HAS IT. NO ONE
ELSE CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU CAN
. YOUR DATA IS KEY TO SETTING
YOUR ORGANIZATION APART FROM THE
PACK. AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED,
GENERATIVE AI HAS JUST MADE IT
SO MUCH MORE RELEVANT AND
IMPACTFUL WHEN YOU TAILOR YOUR
DATA. SO LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM A
LONG TIME CUSTOMER ABOUT HOW
THEY'RE USING DATA TO CREATE
FIRST CLASS EXPERIENCES FOR
THEIR CUSTOMERS. SO PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE, STEPHANE
DURACH, VP OF CONNECTED COMPANY
AT BMW.
THANK YOU. HELLO EVERYONE. IT'S
FANTASTIC TO BE HERE. I COULDN'T
AGREE MORE DATA IS KEY. THE
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCT COMPLEXITY IS
STRONGLY INCREASED. KING AND
DEVELOPMENT SPEED IS ESSENTIAL.
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW BMW IS
MASTERING DATA ACCELERATING THE
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND
DELIVERING BEST IN CLASS
EXPERIENCE TO OUR CUSTOMER
ANYWHERE. AND ANYTIME ACROSS THE
ENTIRE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO FROM
BMW TO MINI AND EVEN ROLLS-ROYCE
, BMW IS PROVIDING GAME CHANGING
VEHICLE ENTERTAINMENT AND
EXPERIENCE POWERED BY AWS. WE
OPTIMIZE OUR TECH STACK, IMPROVE
OUR WORKFLOW AND USE DATA BY
LEVERAGING AWS CLOUD TECHNOLOGY.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES.
CLOUD DATA, BMW CENTRAL DATA
LAKE BUILT BY BMW AND AWS HOSTED
DATA FROM OUR CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET AND BY UPLOADING UPHOLDING
THE STRICTEST DATA PRIVACY
STANDARDS ON TOP OF IT, TEAMS
CAN BUILD THEIR APPLICATION AND
MODEL AS WELL AS DEPLOY UPDATES
AND IMPROVEMENTS TOGETHER. WE
ARE EXPLORING INNOVATIVE USE OF
MACHINE LEARNING, INCLUDING
AMAZON SAGEMAKER. THIS AUTOMATED
DRIVING PLATFORM IS BY BMW IS
BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF
DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEM ON
AWS. THIS AUTOMATED DRIVING
PLATFORM IS CAPABLE TO HANDLE
SEVERAL HUNDRED PETABYTE OF DATA
FROM OUR GLOBAL TEST FLEET. WE
ARE ACCELERATE TESTING OUR
DEVELOPMENT, SIMULATING AND
VALIDATION PROCESS DRAMATICALLY
FOR OUR PRODUCT LAUNCH IN 2025
WITH OUR ROUTE OPTIMIZED
CHARGING SERVICES, WE ARE
PROVIDING REAL TIME TRAFFIC
CALCULATION BASED ON DRIVING
STYLE PREFERENCE TRAFFIC OR
AVAILABLE CHARGING STATIONS AND
MANY MORE. WE ALSO USE AMAZON
TECHNOLOGY LIKE ALEXA FOR OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
AND FIRE TV TO CREATE UNIQUE
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, INSIGHT,
THE VEHICLE, OUR CONNECTED
VEHICLE AI PLATFORM IS BUILT ON
AWS AND FORMED THE BACKBONE OF
THE LARGEST CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET WHERE DE FOR SOME MORE
EVEN EYE OPENING STATS, LET'S
DIVE IN. 20 YEARS AGO BMW
INTRODUCED ITS FIRST VEHICLE
CONNECTED VEHICLE AND WE COME
QUITE A LONG WAY SINCE THEN. AND
NOW THE BMW GROUP HAS THE
LARGEST CONNECTED FLEET WITH
MORE THAN 20 MILLION VEHICLES
GLOBALLY OVER THE LAST THREE
YEARS. WE MIGRATED THE CONNECTED
VEHICLE BACKEND TO AWS BY
UTILIZING THE GLOBAL PRESENCE OF
AWS IN MANY REGIONS WORLDWIDE.
WE ARE UPDATE ADDING MORE THAN 6
MILLION VEHICLES OVER THE AIR ON
A REGULAR BASIS. THE THOSE
NUMBERS ARE GROWING CONSTANTLY.
IT REQUIRES TO MANAGE MORE THAN
12 BILLION REQUESTS PER DAY WITH
OVER 1000 DIFFERENT
MICROSERVICES. ULTIMATELY, WE
ARE PROCESSING MORE THAN 110TB
OF DATA TRAFFIC PER DAY WITH A
REMARKABLE RELIABILITY. LOOK AT
THESE NUMBERS. I'M ALWAYS
IMPRESSED, HOWEVER, WITH OUR NEW
PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE. THIS
NUMBER WILL TRIPLE IN THE NEXT
TWO YEARS. LET'S CHANGE
PERSPECTIVE AND TAKE A LOOK AT A
COUPLE OF NUMBERS IN THE
DEVELOPMENT PHASE. MORE THAN
8500 SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
WORLDWIDE CREATE FIRST CLASS
CODE FOR OUR VEHICLE AND
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE BMW SERIES
RUN SEVEN SERIES RUNS ON OVER
500 MILLION LINES OF CODE. OUR
WORLDWIDE DEV OPS TEAMS EXECUTE
MORE THAN 110 SOFTWARE, BUILDS
EVERY DAY BY USING MORE THAN
60,000 VIRTUAL CPUS TO KEEP UP
WITH OUR DEMAND. WE USE AWS
SERVICES TO SCALE UP AND
ACCELERATE DEVELOPMENT WHENEVER
IT IS NECESSARY. LET'S TAKE A
DEEPER LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT.
TRADITIONALLY, BMW'S COMES FROM
A HARDWARE DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
AND EVERY DEVELOPER HAD TO DO
THE DEVELOPMENT WORK ON A
PHYSICAL TEST TRACK. TODAY WE
ARE USING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY
TO STREAMLINE OUR INFOTAINMENT
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE NEW
APPROACH ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE
TEST FUNCTIONALITIES REMOTELY TO
OUR GLOBAL DEVELOPER TEAMS. AN
EXAMPLE IS USING AMAZON EC2 FOR
VIRTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE
CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COLLABORATION.
OUR NEXT STEP IS TO EXTEND THIS
APPROACH TO BUILD A FULLY
VIRTUAL DIGITAL TWIN. NOW LET'S
TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND SOME
EXCITING FEATURES WE CREATED FOR
OUR MINI CUSTOMERS. ON THE
PICTURE, YOU CAN SEE THE MINI
INTERIOR. IT'S OUR WAY TO
EMPHASIZE BRAND TYPICAL DESIGN.
TAKE THE IMPRESSIVE ROUND ALI
DISPLAY IN OUR NEW MINI FAMILY.
AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, OUR SPEECH
IS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE DOMINANT
MODALITY FOR INTERACTING WITH
VEHICLES. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY
INTEGRATING ALEXA VOICE
ASSISTANT. HOWEVER, THIS YEAR WE
ARE RAISING THE BAR. WE WILL USE
ALEXA TECHNOLOGY TO BRING OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL. NOW LET'S
TAKE A SEAT IN THE BACK OF OUR
SEVEN SERIES. ONE OF OUR MOST
EXCITING FEATURE IS THE BMW
THEATER SCREEN. IT'S THE 30 INCH
SCREEN WITH AN EIGHT K
RESOLUTION. IT IS SPECTACULAR,
INTEGRATED IN THE CAR. IT GIVES
YOU A REAL CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE
WITH FIRE TV. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN
SEAMLESSLY ENJOY THEIR FAVORITE
SERIES AND MOVIES. IT'S OUR
STRONG COLLABORATION WITH AWS
AND AMAZON THAT UNLOCKS NEW
POSSIBILITIES, ENABLE US TO
THINK ABOUT THE CAR IN A NEW
DIMENSION. SO ONE LAST THING TO
GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE INTO THE
FUTURE. THIS IS THE BMW NEW
CLASS. THIS WILL LAUNCH IN 2025.
BMW HAS BEEN ALWAYS ON THE
FOREFRONT OF AUTOMOTIVE
INNOVATION. THE NEW CLASS WILL
BE A QUANTUM LEAP IN CUSTOMER
EXPERIENCE. IT WILL TAKE THE
DRIVING EXPERIENCE TO A NEW
LEVEL AS YOU CAN SEE, THE NEW
CLASS INTRODUCED A COMPLETELY
NEW INTERIOR WITH THE BMW
PANORAMIC VISION. WE DEVELOPED A
NEW HEAD UP DISPLAY TO PROJECT
INFORMATION PILLAR TO PILLAR,
AND FOR THE PERFECT DRIVER
ORIENTATION AND USER EXPERIENCE.
ALL OF THIS EMPHASIZES IMPROVE.
BMW IS MASTERING DATA
ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT
PROCESS AND DELIVERING THE BEST
IN CLASS EXPERIENCE TO THE
CUSTOMER ANYWHERE AND ANYTIME
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EXCITING AND
ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT
NOW. AWS AND THE BMW GROUP ARE
WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER TO
SHAPE THIS FUTURE. THANK YOU
ALL. GOODBYE AND I'LL SEE YOU
SOON. FOR AN INCREDIBLE DATA
PLATFORM YOU'VE BUILT AND THE
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE IT'S
CREATING FOR YOUR CONSUMERS.
JUST AMAZING. THANK YOU, STEFAN.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU, AS
ALWAYS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO
AS STEFAN HAS JUST MADE SO
CLEAR, SUCCESS WITH AI AS WELL
AS WITH NEARLY EVERY OTHER
BUSINESS PRIORITY RELIES ON
HAVING A STRONG DATA STRATEGY.
AND ONE QUESTION I HEAR FROM
CUSTOMERS FREQUENTLY IS HOW
SHOULD I THINK ABOUT DATA IN A
GENERATIVE AI WORLD? WELL, THE
ANSWER IS THAT FOR GENERATIVE
AI, YOUR DATA IS YOUR
DIFFERENTIATOR. NOW WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT CUSTOMIZATION THROUGH
BEDROCK CODEWHISPERER
CUSTOMIZATIONS, AMAZON TAILORED
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND EXAMPLES
FROM DELTA AIRLINES AND PFIZER
ALL TAL ADDING CONTEXT TO YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA IS ABSOLUTELY
CRITICAL TO PROVIDING VALUE.
NOW, IN EACH OF THESE EXAMPLES,
ALS, THE DATA USED TO CUSTOMIZE
THE APPLICATION HAS TO BE UP TO
DATE. IT HAD TO BE COMPLETE AND
ACCURATE. IT HAD TO BE
DISCOVERABLE AND IT HAD TO BE
AVAILABLE WHEN YOU NEEDED IT. SO
THE FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING ALL
OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE YOUR
DATA IS IN THE CLOUD. NOW,
GENERATIVE AI IS JUST ONE OF
MANY REASONS THAT YOU WANT THIS.
HAVING EFFECTIVE CLOUD BASED
DATA STRATEGY IS GOING TO
INCREASE YOUR INSIGHT. IT'S
GOING TO REDUCE YOUR COST AND
IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE
INNOVATION. NOW, TO UNDERSTAND
THIS, JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MANY
DIFFERENT ISSUES THERE ARE TO
CONSIDER WHEN TRYING TO MAKE THE
MOST OF YOUR DATA. ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA. IT
COMES FROM DIFFERENT ORIGINS,
AND IT COMES AT VARIOUS SCALES
AND SPEEDS AS DIFFERENT TEAMS
ALL ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION ARE
GOING TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT
DATA IN MANY, MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF WAYS. AND THEN HOW YOU
WANT TO USE THIS DATA IS JUST AS
VARIED. YOUR STORING IT, YOUR
POWERING, YOUR APPLICATIONS,
YOUR ANALYZING IT, YOU'RE
GENERATING PREDICTIONS FROM IT.
THERE'S NO ONE TOOL OR SOLUTION
THAT CAN DO IT ALL UNLESS YOU'RE
WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES LIKE
PERFORMANCE COST OR
CAPABILITIES. BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE THOSE SACRIFICE CHOICES.
SO WHAT YOU NEED IS A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF TOOLS THAT
ACCOUNTS FOR THE SCALE AND THE
VARIETY OF THIS DATA AND THE
MANY, MANY PURPOSES FOR WHICH
YOU WANT TO USE IT. YOU NEED TO
INTEGRATE IT AND COMBINE ALL
THAT DATA THAT'S SPREAD ALL OVER
TO CREATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND PREDICT
WHAT WILL HAPPEN. AND OF COURSE,
YOU NEED GOVERNANCE SO THAT YOU
CAN HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE OF
ACCESS AND CONTROL EVERY STEP OF
THE WAY. YOU NEED IT ALL. IF YOU
MISS EVEN ONE ASPECT, YOUR
ABILITY TO USE THAT DATA IS
SIGNIFICANTLY HOBBLED. SO IN
ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN
STORE, ANALYZE AND PROCESS THE
DATA YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF DATA
SERVICES SO YOU CAN GET THE
PRICE PERFORMANCE, YOU CAN GET
THE SPEED, THE FLEXIBILITY AND
THE CAPABILITIES FOR YOUR USE
CASE. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
BUILT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SET
OF CLOUD DATA SERVICES OUT THERE
. SO TO START, WE HAVE AMAZON S3
AND CUSTOMERS USE S3 TO MAKE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DATA
LAKES WHERE THEY CAN BRING
STRUCTURED DATA TOGETHER WITH
UNSTRUCTURED DATA AND MAKE IT
ALL AVAILABLE FOR ANALYTICS AND
MACHINE LEARNING. WE ALSO OFFER
EIGHT RELATIONAL DATABASES,
INCLUDING AMAZON, AURORA THE
RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICE
THAT'S BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP
FOR THE CLOUD AND IS STILL THE
FASTEST GROWING SERVICE IN AWS
HISTORY. WE ALSO HAVE EIGHT
PURPOSE BUILT DATABASES, NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES, INCLUDING
AMAZON DYNAMODB, WHICH IS USED
BY OVER A MILLION DEVELOPERS
SORRY, A MILLION CUSTOMERS FOR
ITS SERVERLESS SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND PERFORMANCE AT ANY
SCALE. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE
BROADEST AND DEEPEST SET OF
ANALYTICS SERVICES AND THIS
INCLUDES OUR DATA WAREHOUSE
SERVICE, AMAZON REDSHIFT, WHICH
DELIVERS UP TO SIX OR EVEN SEVEN
TIMES BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
DEPENDING ON YOUR WORKLOAD THAN
OTHER CLOUD DATA WAREHOUSES.
WE'VE GOT AMAZON EMR TO EASILY
RUN SPARK AND OTHER BIG DATA
WORKLOADS AND AMAZON OPENSEARCH
SERVICE WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF ACTIVE CUSTOMERS AND HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF CLUSTERS UNDER
MANAGEMENT. AND THAT ALL
PROCESSES TRILLIONS OF REQUESTS
PER MONTH AND MANY, MANY, MANY
MORE ANALYTIC SERVICES. I WON'T
GO THROUGH THEM ALL, BUT YOU
NEED THIS BREADTH AND THIS DEPTH
OF CHOICE SO THAT YOU CAN NEVER
HAVE TO COMPROMISE ON COST, ON
PERFORMANCE OR ON SCALE, AND
INSTEAD YOU CAN CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOL FOR THE JOB. NOW, WE'VE
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT AI AND ML
EXTENSIVELY, SO I'M NOT GOING TO
DWELL ON THAT HERE. BUT YOU NEED
TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOLS TO FEED YOUR AI AND
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'RE
DOING IN YOUR BUSINESS. AND THE
SECOND THING THAT YOU NEED AS
YOU MOVE TO PUT DATA AT THE
CENTER OF YOUR BUSINESS IS TO
BREAK DOWN YOUR DATA SILOS. MOST
PEOPLE HAVE DATA SPREAD OUT ALL
OVER THE ORGANIZATION IN
DATABASES, ANALYTIC TOOLS, SAAS
APPLICATIONS, SPREADSHEETS AND
MORE. AND TO GET THE MOST VALUE
FROM YOUR DATA, YOU NEED TO BE
ABLE TO USE IT ALL. NO MATTER
WHERE IT LIVES. AND TO DO THIS
TODAY, MOST PEOPLE MOVE DATA
AROUND OR TRY TO CONNECT THE
VARIOUS SILOS USING A PROCESS
CALLED ETL OR EXTRACT, TRANSFORM
AND LOAD. YEAH, I SEE SOME OF
YOU FLINCHED WHEN I SAID THAT
BECAUSE YOU KNOW. RIGHT. YOU
KNOW EXACTLY HOW BAD THIS
PROCESS CAN BE. IT IS TEARING
ALL FIRST DEVELOPERS HAVE TO
DESIGN AN ETL PIPELINE
ARCHITECTURE. THEY HAVE TO
DECIDE WHERE TO EXTRACT THE DATA
FROM, AND IT'S OFTEN COMING FROM
MULTIPLE SOURCES. THEN THEY HAVE
TO WRITE CODE TO TRANSFORM THE
DATA AND REMOVE DUPLICATES. THEY
HAVE TO FILTER OUT OUTLIERS,
RETRIEVE MISSING DATA AND
IDENTIFY CORRUPTED DATA. AFTER
ALL THAT, YOU HAVE TO TRANSFORM.
YOU HAVE TO LOAD YOUR TRANSFORM
DATA TO ITS NEW DESTINATION,
WHICH ONCE AGAIN MEANS MORE CODE
TO WRITE. THEN, IF SOMETHING
CHANGES, LIKE A DATA ENGINEER
SWAPPING OUT A DATA TABLE OR
ADDING A NEW FIELD, YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK AGAIN AND UPDATE ALL OF
YOUR CODE ONCE MORE. IT IS
MONOTONOUS, IT IS TEDIOUS AND IT
IS JUST A WHOLE LOT OF UNFUN
WORK, WHICH IS WHY WE INTRODUCED
OUR VISION OF A ZERO ETL FUTURE
FOR AND IN THIS FUTURE YOU CAN
WAVE GOODBYE TO THE BORING,
FRUSTRATING PROCESS OF ETL. YOUR
DATA IS AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTED
FROM THE SOURCE TO THE
DESTINATION. IT'S THAT EASY AND
YOU GET YOUR DATA WHERE YOU NEED
IT WHEN YOU NEED IT. NO MORE
BUILDING AND MANAGING COMPLEX,
BRITTLE PROCESSES AND PIPELINES.
IT'S REALLY EXCITING. BUT IS IT
REAL? WELL, IS IT DOWN PAYMENT?
LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED A FULLY
MANAGED ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
BETWEEN AURORA, MYSQL AND
REDSHIFT. WITHIN SECONDS OF DATA
BEING WRITTEN INTO AURORA, YOU
CAN USE REDSHIFT TO DO NEAR REAL
TIME ANALYTICS AND ON PETABYTES
OF DATA. YOU CAN ENABLE THIS
INTEGRATION WITH JUST A FEW
CLICKS AND ZERO-ETL. IT IS
INCREDIBLY EASY NOW THIS FIRST
ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IS READY,
IS READY DONE. BUT WE'VE WE'VE
WE WANT TO DELIVER SO MUCH MORE.
AND SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TODAY
TO BE ANNOUNCING THREE MORE ZERO
ETL INTEGRATIONS WITH REDSHIFT.
LET'S GET THEM ALL DONE AT ONCE.
AURORA POSTGRES RDS FOR MYSQL
AND DYNAMODB. THESE ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS AND AMAZON REDSHIFT
ARE ALL AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW
WHEN TODAY. SO. SO THAT MAKES.
YEAH. YOU DON'T LIKE THE MUCK,
DO YOU? SO THAT'S FOUR OF OUR
MOST POPULAR RELATIONAL AND NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES TOGETHER
WITH THE DATA WAREHOUSE THAT
GIVES YOU THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITHOUT ANY OF THE
ETL FANTASTIC. BUT REMEMBER,
WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THIS VISION.
SO OF COURSE OUR NEXT QUESTION
WAS, WELL, WHERE ELSE COULD WE
BE REMOVING THE PAIN OF ETL?
NOW, MANY OF YOU NEED TO USE
SEARCH ON YOUR TRANSACTIONAL
DATA TO ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE
OF YOUR APPLICATION. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE AN
E-COMMERCE APPLICATION AND YOU
WANT TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED
RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOUR USER,
YOU USE SIMILARITY SEARCH ON
TRANSACTION DATA. THAT'S GOING
TO BE STORED IN YOUR DATABASE.
SO TO DO THIS CURRENTLY YOU'RE
DESIGNING, YOU'RE BUILDING,
YOU'RE MANAGING COMPLEX DATA
PIPELINE ARCHITECTURES FROM YOUR
DATABASE TO A SEARCH ENGINE. AND
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOU ARE
BUILDING THOSE PIPELINES TO
AMAZON OPENSEARCH SERVICE FOR
ITS POWERFUL SEARCH CAPABILITIES
. I BET YOU CAN TELL WHERE WE'RE
GOING WITH THIS. SO TODAY I'M
REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE UNVEILED
ONE MORE ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IN
DYNAMO. DB ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
WITH OPENSEARCH SERVICE
GENERALLY AVAILABLE TODAY. AND
THIS NEW INTEGRATION MAKES IT SO
EASY TO SEARCH DYNAMODB DATA
WITH OUR OPENSEARCH SERVICE. AND
IT'S JUST THE FIRST OF THESE
DATABASE INTEGRATIONS TO OUR
OPENSEARCH SERVICE THAT'S GOING
TO HELP YOU DO MORE WITH DATA.
SO OUR NEW ZERO-ETL INTEGRATIONS
ARE BRINGING TRANSACTIONAL DATA
AND ANALYTICS TOGETHER FASTER
AND MORE EASILY AND CUSTOMERS
ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE
IDEA OF A ZERO-ETL FUTURE. SO
YOU CAN BE CERTAIN WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP INNOVATING HERE. NOW
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE
TOOLS THAT YOU NEED AND HOW YOU
CAN HAVE DATA WHERE YOU NEED IT
WITHOUT THE PAINFUL ETL BURDEN.
NEXT YOU WANT TO EMPOWER PEOPLE
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION TO USE
YOUR DATA TO ITS FULLEST AND YOU
WANT THEM WALLOWING IN YOUR
DATA, EXPERIMENTING, ASKING
QUESTIONS, SPARKING IDEAS. AND
YOU WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS.
BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM YOUR
DATA IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE, SO
YOU WANT TO GRANT ACCESS ONLY TO
THE RIGHT EMPLOYEES AT THE RIGHT
TIME. YOU NEED TO KEEP IT SAFE
AND SECURE. SO YOU ALSO NEED
CONTROL, YOUR ACCESS CONTROL.
KOHL THESE ARE OPPOSITES, RIGHT?
NO, YOU CAN HAVE IN FACT, YOU
MUST HAVE BOTH AND THE KEY TO
MAKING SURE THAT YOUR DATA IS,
IS SAFE, IS GOVERNED, HAS ACCESS
, IS GOVERNANCE CREATING
VISIBILITY INTO YOUR DATA AND
CONTROLLING WHO CAN ACCESS YOUR
DATA AND WHEN THEY CAN ACCESS IT
WITH ROBUST GOVERNANCE, YOU'RE
GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO
THE DATA THEY NEED AND ONLY THAT
DATA. AND WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT
DATA YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW WHERE IT
IS. YOU HAVE GUARDRAILS AND
TOOLS IN PLACE TO SAFELY UNLOCK
IT. THAT BUILDS CONFIDENCE. AND
THEN PEOPLE WITHIN THE
ORGANIZATION DEVELOP TRUST IN
THE DATA. YOU ACTUALLY EMPOWER
INNOVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION
RATHER THAN STIFLING IT. AND SO
TO HELP YOU WITH GOVERNANCE, WE
DEVELOPED AMAZON DATAZONE DATA
ZONES, A DATA MANAGEMENT SERVICE
THAT HELPS YOU CATALOG,
DISCOVER, SHARE AND GOVERN DATA
ACROSS YOUR ORGANIZATION. WE'RE
GETTING GREAT FEEDBACK FROM LOTS
OF DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
LEADER IN BRAZIL, ITAU. AND
WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE
IMPACT THAT DATA ZONE IS HAVING
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY IN THIS SPACE.
TODAY, DATA ZONE USES MACHINE
LEARNING TO AUTOMATICALLY ADD
METADATA TO YOUR CATALOG, BUT IN
ORDER TO FIND THE RIGHT DATA AT
THE RIGHT TIME, CUSTOMERS STILL
HAVE TO CHOOSE TO ADD BUSINESS
CONTEXT LIKE EXPLAINING THE
DATA'S PURPOSE OR CLARIFYING THE
COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS. AND NOW
THIS HELPS EMPLOYEES FIND THE
DATA THAT THEY NEED. IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
KNOW THE DATA EXISTS, THE
QUESTION OF ACCESS AND CONTROL
BECOMES MOOT. BUT ADDING ALL
THIS DATA IS A METADATA IS
TEDIOUS. IT'S A MANUAL PROCESS.
WELL, NO LONGER. WE'RE MAKING
YOUR CATALOGING EVEN SMARTER.
AND TODAY I'M REALLY PLEASED TO
ANNOUNCE A NEW CAPABILITY THAT
AUTOMATICALLY SUGGESTS BUSINESS
DESCRIPTIONS TO ADD CONTEXT FOR
YOUR DATA SET IN JUST A FEW
CLICKS, CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS
SIMPLY CHOOSE A DATA SET AND
DATAZONE WILL USE GENERATIVE AI
TO CREATE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS
FOR YOUR DATA. USING OUR TRAINED
MODELS. MAKING IT EASIER TO
UNDERSTAND THESE DESCRIPTIONS
CAN BE REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED, OR
EVEN FURTHER CLARIFIED OR EDITED
FOR YOUR EXACT PREFERENCES. DATA
ZONES ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO USE
YOUR DATA. THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE
TIME SAVER IN THIS CAPABILITY IS
GOING TO HELP EMPLOYEES TO FIND
THE RIGHT DATA FOR EVEN FASTER
INSIGHTS. WE'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE TO HELP YOU
USE DATA GOVERNANCE TO SET YOUR
DATA FREE. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
DO IN YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED AN
END TO END DATA STRATEGY THAT
PROVIDES CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE
ENTIRE SPAN OF YOUR DATA NEEDS.
YOU NEED TO EASILY CONNECT DATA
ACROSS SILOS AND YOU NEED YOU
NEED YOUR DATA TO BE GOVERNED TO
BE CONFIDENT THAT THE RIGHT DATA
IS USED IN THE RIGHT WAYS BY
ONLY THE RIGHT PEOPLE. WE'RE
MAKING AWS THE BEST PLACE FOR
ALL OF YOUR DATA NEEDS ACROSS
ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS.
AND WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS AND
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO MAKE DATA,
YOUR DIFFERENTIATOR IN AI AND
ACROSS YOUR BUSINESS, IT'S
AMAZING. WE'VE TALKED A LOT
ABOUT REINVENTION TODAY AND HERE
AT AWS THE MOST IMPORTANT
REINVENTION OF ALL IS YOURS TO
SUPPORT YOU IN ALL THE WAYS THAT
YOU WANT TO ADAPT AND EVOLVE. WE
CONTINUOUSLY CONTINUE TO
CHALLENGE OURSELVES. WE TRY AND
THINK DIFFERENTLY. WE TRY AND
GIVE YOU THE CAPABILITY WIZ THAT
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED, AND EVEN
SOME MAYBE THAT YOU'VE NEVER
IMAGINED. NOW, THIS ISN'T THE
WORK OF A FEW MONTHS OR EVEN A
YEAR, BUT WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT.
WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE AT
AMAZON WE MAKE BOLD BETS. SO
THIRD PARTY SELLING ON AMAZON
PRIME, EVEN AWS ITSELF IS A BIG
BET. I MEAN, IT TOOK A LOT OF
YEARS AND A LOT OF CAPITAL TO
BUILD OUT THE ON DEMAND
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES THAT
SIMPLY BECAME KNOWN AS THE CLOUD
FOR THIS LONG TERM FOCUS IS A
GOOD THING. BEING WILLING TO
THINK DIFFERENTLY AND LONG TERM
IS A GOOD THING. IT'S THE ONLY
PREDICTABLE WAY TO PROFOUNDLY
CHANGE WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR
CUSTOMERS. AWS. NOW THERE'S
ANOTHER BIG BET THAT AMAZON IS
MAKING YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF
PROJECT KUIPER AND YEAH, KUIPER.
KUIPER'S BUILDING A
CONSTELLATION OF THOUSANDS OF
LOW EARTH ORBIT SATELLITES. WHY?
WELL, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE ON EARTH LACK FAST OR
RELIABLE OR EVEN ANY INTERNET
ACCESS. PROJECT KUIPER IS GOING
TO HELP CLOSE THAT DIGITAL
DIGITAL DIVIDE BY DELIVERING
FAST, AFFORDABLE BROADBAND TO A
WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS
OPERATING IN PLACES WITHOUT
RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTIONS.
IN FACT, JUST LAST MONTH, KUIPER
, THE KUIPER TEAM SUCCESSFULLY
LAUNCHED ITS FIRST TWO PROTOSTAR
SATELLITES INTO ORBIT. IT'S JUST
INCREDIBLE THING. I MEAN, THEY
PUT SATELLITES UP THERE. THEY'RE
WORKING FLAWLESSLY. EVERYBODY'S
REALLY HAPPY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED
THERE RIGHT? WOW I MEAN, KUIPER
IS A GLOBAL HIGH SPEED SATELLITE
NETWORK THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE
COVERAGE IN PLACES THAT HAVE
NEVER HAD COVERAGE BEFORE. I
MEAN, IMAGINE THE POWER OF
DELIVERING A REALLY HARD TO
REACH PLACES, THE ABILITY TO
ACCESS THE INTERNET WITH THE
SAME SPEED. THE SAME RELIABILITY
THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED
EVERY DAY. NOW, THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR CONSUMERS IS,
FOR SURE, ENORMOUS. BUT SO ARE
THE BENEFITS TO BUSINESSES AND
GOVERNMENTS. AND THERE ARE ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES LIKE
RENEWABLE ENERGY PROVIDERS THAT
WANT TO ANALYZE IN REAL TIME
DATA FROM OFF SHORE WIND FARMS
OR FIRST RESPONDERS WHO NEED
FAST, RELIABLE CONNECTIONS
DURING NATURAL DISASTERS OR
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LOOKING
FOR CONNECTIVITY, BACKUP IN CASE
OF AN UNPLANNED OUTAGE. KUIPER
IS GOING TO HELP TO MAKE ALL OF
THIS POSSIBLE AND AWS CUSTOMERS
ARE ALREADY PLANNING FOR THE
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS OPENS UP
TO CONNECT TO THEIR FACILITIES,
THEIR SENSORS, THEIR DATA, THEIR
NETWORKS. IT'S GOING TO BE
AMAZING FOR SO MANY CUSTOMERS,
BUT SOME CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
DON'T WANT THEIR DATA RUNNING
OVER THE PUBLIC INTERNET. AND AS
YOU KNOW, SECURITY IS ALWAYS OUR
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. SO TODAY,
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THAT IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, KUIPER IS
ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE ENTERPRISE
READY PRIVATE CONNECTIVITY
SERVICES. AND NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE DATA FROM
VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE OVER PRIVATE
SECURE CONNECTIONS. AND AS YOU
USE USE THESE CONNECTIONS WITH
YOUR DATA, YOU CAN USE IT INSIDE
OF THE AWS CLOUD TO AN EARLY
ADOPTERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
START TESTING IN THE SECOND HALF
OF 2024. SO WE MAKE BIG BETS
LIKE THESE SO THAT CUSTOMERS CAN
DO THINGS THAT THEY COULDN'T
IMAGINE BEFORE. AND YOU COME ON
THIS JOURNEY WITH US BECAUSE
WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THESE
KINDS OF AUDACIOUS LEAPS AND THE
BENEFITS HAVE BEEN ENORMOUS. THE
EXCITING CHALLENGE AHEAD OF ALL
OF US THIS NEXT YEAR IS TO LOOK
CLOSELY AT OUR WORK AND TO
REIMAGINE IT, TO REINVENT IT, TO
DREAM UP EXPERIENCES THAT WERE
PREVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE AND MAKE
THEM REAL. WE ARE SO EXCITED TO
BE YOUR PARTNER IN THIS NEW
WORLD THAT WE'RE BUILDING
TOGETHER, AND I'M THRILLED THAT
WE GET TO EXPLORE IT. ALL THIS
WEEK. THIS MORNING. IT'S BEEN
INCREDIBLE. I WANT TO THANK ALL
OF MY GUESTS ON STAGE TODAY AND
THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WATCHING
AND OF COURSE, THANK YOU TO THE
WHOLE AWS TEAM FOR WORKING SO
HARD TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. NOW,
THE TEAM DOES HAVE ONE MORE
LITTLE SURPRISE UP UP THEIR
COLLECTIVE SLEEVE. SO I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE VERY
BEGINNING I MENTIONED LOUD AND
GUITARS IN IRELAND, BUT WE
ACTUALLY HAVE A LOUD GUITAR HERE
FROM OUR FRIENDS AT LOUDEN AND
WE'VE INVITED A TALENTED
GUITARIST A LONG TIME AWS
FAVORITE ZACH PERSON TO PLAY US
OUT. SO WE HAVE GOT A GREAT
CONFERENCE HERE FOR YOU THIS
WEEK. NOW LET'S GET OUT THERE
AND REINVENT. THANK YOU. NOW
TAKE IT AWAY, ZACH.
PLEASE WELCOME THE CEO OF AWS,
ADAM SELIPSKY.
GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE
12TH ANNUAL REINVENT. I AM SO
HAPPY TO BE HERE WITH MORE THAN
50,000 OF YOU HERE IN LAS VEGAS
AND MORE THAN 300,000 WATCHING
AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR
JOINING. THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU
. NOW, WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THIS
EVENT JUST A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENTLY AND REINVENT REMAINS
ABOVE ALL, A LEARNING
CONFERENCE, A LEARNING EVENT,
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN
AND GROW HERE ARE EVERYWHERE.
WE'VE GOT MORE THAN 2200
SESSIONS, AND YOU CAN CONNECT
WITH AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
PARTNERS IN THE EXPO ALL AROUND.
AND OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY,
MANY OPPORTUNITY WIZ TO CONNECT
WITH FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE AWS
COMMUNITY. SO WE'VE ALSO GOT A
GREAT SLATE OF KEYNOTES FOR YOU.
YESTERDAY, LAST NIGHT, HOPEFULLY
A LOT OF YOU SAW PETER DIVE INTO
ALL OF OUR INNOVATION AROUND
SERVERLESS. AND TOMORROW WE'VE
GOT SWAMI ON AI AND MACHINE
LEARNING AS WELL AS RUBA'S
PARTNER KEYNOTE. AND THEN OF
COURSE, WERNER CAPS OFF THE WEEK
ON THURSDAY. BUT I'M EXTREMELY
EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE IN
STORE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW HERE
TODAY. SO LET'S GET STARTED. SO
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT
REINVENT IS THE SHEER VARIETY OF
THE CUSTOMERS THAT I GET TO
MEET. I MEAN, FOLKS FROM EVERY
INDUSTRY, EVERY REGION, EVERY
USE CASE. AND THERE'S JUST
NOTHING LIKE IT ANYWHERE FOR AN
INNOVATORS ALL OVER THE WORLD
ARE RELYING ON AWS TO DRIVE
THEIR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING
LEADING ENTERPRISES FROM ACROSS
EVERY INDUSTRY, JUST TO NAME A
FEW IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE'RE
WORKING WITH JPMORGAN CHASE.
WE'RE WORKING WITH GOLDMAN
SACHS, NASDAQ, FIDELITY, ALLIANZ
ITYOU, BBVA, HSBC, GE CAPITAL
ONE, S&P GLOBAL NUBANK AND MORE.
IN HEALTH CARE, WE'RE WORKING
WITH PFIZER, GILEAD, MERCK, NOVO
NORDISK ROCHE, MODERNA, ILLUMINA
. MEDTRONIC 3M HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MORE. IN
AUTOMOTIVE, WE'RE WORKING WITH
EVERYBODY FROM BMW TO STELLANTIS
HONDA, TOYOTA, VW GROUP, NISSAN,
HYUNDAI, FORD MOTOR COMPANY,
MERCEDES BENZ, AND OF COURSE,
MORE. SO MANY AMAZING CUSTOMERS
AND PARTNERS AND STILL JUST A
SMATTERING OF THE LEADERS WE'RE
WORKING WITH TO SHAPE THE
FUTURES OF THESE INDUSTRIES. AND
ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
THAT THEY SERVE. ONE CUSTOMER
AND PARTNER. WE'VE BEEN WORKING
CLOSELY WITH FOR A NUMBER OF
YEARS IS SALESFORCE. SO IN 2016,
SALESFORCE CHOSE AWS AS THEIR
PRIMARY CLOUD PROVIDER, AND
TODAY SALESFORCE USES AWS
COMPUTE STORAGE DATA SERVICE AS
MANY OTHERS TO POWER KEY
SERVICES LIKE SALESFORCE, DATA
CLOUD AND MANY OTHERS. AND
YESTERDAY WE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
OUR PARTNERSHIP TO BRING NEW
CAPABILITIES TO OUR MUTUAL
CUSTOMERS. SALESFORCE IS GOING
TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
ITS ALREADY VERY LARGE USE OF
AWS. AWS WILL BE USING MORE
SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGIES AND
WE'RE MAKING IT EASIER FOR
DEVELOPERS TO QUICKLY BUILD AND
DEPLOY GENERATIVE AI
APPLICATIONS. JENS BY BRINGING
TOGETHER AMAZON BEDROCK WITH
SALESFORCE'S EINSTEIN PLATFORM.
WE'RE ALSO HELPING TO UNIFY DATA
MANAGEMENT WITH OUR NEW ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS BETWEEN SALESFORCE
DATA CLOUD AND AWS STORAGE AND
COMPUTE AND DATA SERVICE DATA
AND ANALYTICS SERVICES. SO THE
CUSTOMERS CAN GET EVEN BETTER
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND WE'RE ALSO
BUILDING TIGHTER INTEGRATIONS
BETWEEN SERVICE CLOUD FROM
SALESFORCE AND AMAZON CONNECT.
ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME,
SALESFORCE IS GOING TO BE
PUTTING ITS PRODUCTS ON THE
MARKET PLACE, MAKING IT EVEN
EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO FIND, TO
BUY AND TO MANAGE SALESFORCE
OFFERINGS. SO WITH THIS EXPANDED
PARTNERSHIP AND SALESFORCE
CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO GET NEW,
POWERFUL WAYS TO INNOVATE AND
BUILD APPLICATIONS. BUT IT'S NOT
JUST GLOBAL ENTERPRISE IS THE
MOST PROMISING UP AND COMER ALSO
CONTINUE TO CHOOSE AWS AS WELL.
ACCORDING TO PITCHBOOK, THERE
ARE MORE THAN 1000 UNICORNS OR
STARTUPS WITH OVER $1 BILLION IN
VALUATION, AND THE VAST MAJORITY
OF UNICORNS OVER 80% CHOOSE AWS
LIKE WIZ, A CLOUD SECURITY
COMPANY AND GREAT AWS PARTNER.
WIZ IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST CYBER
SECURITY UNICORN AND FASTEST
SAAS COMPANY. TO REACH A $10
BILLION VALUATION. REALLY
AMAZING OR ULTIMATE GENOMICS,
ONE OF FAST COMPANY'S MOST
INNOVATIVE COMPANIES IN BIOTECH
AND ULTIMO IS REVOLUTIONIZING
DNA SEQUENCING BY REDUCING THE
COST OF SEQUENCING SIX FOLD OR
PLAID PLAIDS. A DATA STARTUP
THAT POWERS FINTECH TOOLS LIKE
VENMO, ACORN AND ROBINHOOD THAT
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE USING TO
MANAGE THEIR FINANCES. CUSTOMERS
OF EVERY SIZE, EVERY INDUSTRY,
ORI, EVERY REGION, ORGANIZATIONS
YOU MIGHT NEVER IMAGINE CHAN
WOULD RELY ON THE CLOUD ARE
INNOVATING ON AWS. I JUST
RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT LOUDEN
GUITARS, A K10 EXPERT GUITAR
MAKER LOCATED IN A TINY VILLAGE
IN IRELAND, AND THEY'RE USING
AWS TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN
ELECTRONIC PASSPORT PROGRAM
THAT'S GOING TO EASE THE PASSAGE
OF THEIR VERY SPECIAL GUITARS
FOR MUSICIANS AS THEY TRAVEL
THROUGH CUSTOMS. I MEAN, ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES. IT'S AMAZING
ENTERPRISE WIZ AND STARTUPS,
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED
BUSINESSES, UNIVERSITIES,
COMMUNITY COLLEGES, GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, NONPROFITS. THE CLOUD
IS FOR ANYONE AND OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE SOLVING BIG PROBLEMS,
SERVING CRITICAL NEEDS AND
DREAMING UP THE WORLD'S NEXT BIG
THING. THEY COUNT ON US TO BE
SECURE, TO BE RELIABLE, TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY, TO DELIGHT
THEIR CUSTOMERS AND ENABLE NEW
WAYS TO GROW THEIR BUSINESSES.
ALL ALL ON AWS. SO WHY IS ALL
THIS HAPPENING? ON AWS, WE ARE
RELENTLESS ABOUT WORKING
BACKWARDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS
NEEDS AND FROM THEIR PAIN
POINTS. AND OF COURSE WE WERE
THE FIRST BY ABOUT 5 TO 7 YEARS
TO HAVE THIS BROADEST AND
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES THAT
WE STILL HAVE TODAY. AND WE'RE
THE MOST SECURE AND THE MOST
RELIABLE, BUT WE ALSO THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS
PROBLEMS AND THEIR POTENTIAL.
AND THIS HAS LED US TO REINVENT
CONTINUOUS ALI, TO PUSH THROUGH
THE BARRIERS OF WHAT PEOPLE
THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. SO YOU CAN
DO THE SAME. REINVENTING IS IN
OUR DNA AND IT CONTINUES TO
DRIVE US EVERY DAY. AFTER ALL,
THIS IS HOW CLOUD COMPUTING CAME
TO BE. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF
OPERATING OPERATING AMAZON.COM.
WE EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND HOW
HARD, HOW EXPENSIVE IT WAS TO
PROVISION AND MANAGE
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW MUCH OF
THE UNDIFFERENTIATED HEAVY
LIFTING THERE WAS THAT
DISTRACTED, REALLY TALENTED
TEAMS FROM REALLY INNOVATING. SO
WE SET OUT TO RETHINK IT.
INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETELY WITH
AWS. SO EVERYONE, EVEN A KID AND
A COLLEGE DORM ROOM, COULD HAVE
ACCESS TO THE SAME POWERFUL
TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO THE
LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED
ORGANIZATIONS. ALL ON DEMAND,
ALL SECURE, ALL RELIABLE AND ALL
COST EFFECTIVE. NOW IF FOLKS GOT
PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AS
THEY MOVED INTO THE CLOUD, SOME
EVEN HOSTED DATA CENTER CLOSING
PARTIES AND POSTED VIDEOS OF
SHUTTING DOWN SERVER ROOMS. IT
WAS REALLY, REALLY FUN. THIS WAS
FUN FOR US. SO WE INVENTED
REINVENTED INFRASTRUC FROM THE
GROUND UP TO OPTIMIZE AWS FOR
SCALE, FOR SECURITY, FOR
RELIABILITY, FROM ROUTERS TO
COOLING SYSTEMS TO NETWORKING
PROTOCOLS. AND BECAUSE WE LOOK
AT THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, OUR
GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE WAS
FUNDAMENTALLY DISTINCT FROM THAT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS. AND
THAT IS STILL TRUE TODAY. FOR
EXAMPLE, THE AWS GLOBAL
INFRASTRUCTURE SPANS 32
GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AROUND THE
WORLD AND WE'VE ANNOUNCED PLANS
FOR FIVE OR SO MORE EACH AND
EVERY REGION CONSISTS OF THREE
OR MORE AVAILABILITY ZONES OR
AZS AND NO OTHER CLOUD PROVIDER
PROVIDES THAT IN EVERY SINGLE
GEOGRAPHIC REGION. AND THIS IS
CRITICAL WITH EACH REGION. THE
AZS ARE PHYSICALLY SEPARATED BY
A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE UP TO 60
MILES OR 100KM. AND THEN THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH REDUNDANT
FIBER NETWORK THAT PROVIDES
SINGLE DIGIT MILLISECOND
LATENCY. NOW EACH AZ IS AT LEAST
ONE FULLY DISCRETE DATA CENTER
WITH ITS OWN REDUNDANT POWER
WATER FOR NETWORKING AND
CONNECTIVITY. SO IF THERE'S A
UTILITY FAILURE, UNEXPECTED
TRAFFIC SPIKE, HUMAN MISTAKE OR
EVEN A NATURAL DISASTER, THE
REGION REMAINS OPERATIONAL AND
SO DO YOUR APPLICATIONS. NOW,
OTHERS WOULD HAVE YOU THINK THAT
ALL CLOUDS ARE THE SAME, BUT
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. I MEAN,
IMAGINE IF YOU HAD A REGION
SUPPORTED BY A SINGLE DATA
CENTER OR IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR
PROVIDER HAD MULTIPLE AZS IN
FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND YOU
WERE RESILIENT. BUT IT TURNED
OUT THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THE
SAME LOCATION. I MEAN, ONE
INCIDENT LIKE A WATER LEAK
FOLLOWED BY A FIRE COULD TAKE
DOWN AN ENTIRE REGION FOR DAYS
DUE. HAVING THE BROADEST AND THE
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES
MATTERS LIKE HAVING THREE TIMES
THE THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF
DATA CENTERS COMPARED TO THE
NEXT LARGEST CLOUD PROVIDER,
WHICH MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN
CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY AND
HAVING 60% MORE SERVICES IN OVER
40% MORE FEATURES THAN THE NEXT
CLOSEST CLOUD PROVIDER. SO YOU
CAN INNOVATE WITHOUT
CONSTRAINTS. WE REINVENT IT SO
THAT YOU CAN REINVENT, TAKE
STORAGE, FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE
CERTAINLY DIDN'T INVENT STORAGE,
BUT WE REINVENTED HOW PEOPLE
CONSUME AND SCALE STORAGE IN THE
CLOUD WITH OUR VERY FIRST CLOUD
SERVICE, AMAZON S3, SIMPLE
STORAGE SERVICE SO BACK IN THE
DAY, STORAGE WAS PRIMARILY DISK
ARRAYS, WHICH COULD TAKE WEEKS
TO PROVISION AND OBVIOUSLY HAD
FINITE CAPACITY. SO S3 PROVIDED
HIGHLY DURABLE, HIGHLY
PERFORMANT OBJECT STORAGE THAT
CUSTOMERS COULD SCALE INSTANTLY
AND NEARLY INFINITELY. AND I
REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT S3 AT OUR
VERY FIRST TRADE SHOW IN 2006,
ON THE DAY THAT IT LAUNCHED, AND
FOLKS HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING
THE COST. I MEAN, IT WAS SO
DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN WHAT
THEY WERE USED TO, BUT WE KEPT
GOING. WE ADDED A WHOLE LOT OF
STORAGE TIERS, INCLUDING S3
GLACIER, DEEP ARCHIVE, WHICH
DELIVERS ARCHIVE STORAGE AT LESS
THAN A 10TH OF A CENT PER
GIGABYTE. BUT WHY SHOULD YOU
HAVE TO EVEN FIGURE OUT WHICH
STORAGE TIER TO USE? SO WE BUILT
S3 INTELLIGENT-TIERING TO
OPTIMIZE STORAGE BY
AUTOMATICALLY MOVING DATA TO THE
MOST EFFECTIVE ACCESS TIER WHEN
ACCESS PATTERNS CHANGE.
INTELLIGENT-TIERING HAS ALREADY
SAVED CUSTOMERS. YOU READY? OVER
$2 BILLION, BUT IT'S JUST
STORAGE, RIGHT? I MEAN, HERE'S
TO THE SAVINGS. BUT STORAGE,
RIGHT? I MEAN, SURELY THIS CAN'T
BE AN AREA THAT'S READY FOR MORE
REINVENTION. WELL, RECENTLY
WE'VE BEEN RETHINKING STORAGE
FOR YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED AND MOST LATENCY
SENSITIVE WORKLOADS, WORKLOADS
THAT NEED HIGH PERFORMANCE
ANALYTICS PROCESSING, LIKE
FINANCIAL TRADING ANALYTICS,
REAL TIME ADVERTISING, FRAUD
DETECTION AND MACHINE LEARNING
TRAINING. NOW THESE WORKLOADS
ACCESS DATA UP TO MILLIONS OF
TIMES IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AND
DO REQUIRE SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. AND SO
TODAY WHAT HAPPENS IS CUSTOMERS
MOVE DATA OFTEN FROM S3 TO
CUSTOM CACHING SOLUTIONS AND
THEN RUN ANALYTICS AT THESE
SPEEDS. BUT MANAGING MULTIPLE
STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURES AND APIS
ADDS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY. SO WE
LOOKED HARD AT WHAT WE COULD DO
TO ADD TO S3 OKAY, ARE YOU READY
FOR THE FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF
THE DAY? OKAY SO TODAY I'M
EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE AMAZON S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE, A NEW S3
STORAGE CLASS PURPOSE BUILT.
PURPOSE BUILT TO OFFER THE
HIGHEST PERFORMANCE AND LOWEST
LATENCY CLOUD OBJECT FOR STORAGE
YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY ACCESSED
DATA. S3 EXPRESS ONE ZONE USES
PURPOSE BUILT HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE TO ACCELERATE DATA
PROCESSING. IT ALSO GIVES YOU
THE OPTION TO ACTUALLY CHOOSE
YOUR AZ FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND
YOU CAN BRING YOUR FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED DATA NEXT TO YOUR HIGH
PERFORMANCE COMPUTE RESOURCE WIZ
TO MINIMIZE LATENCY. SO S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE SUPPORTS
MILLIONS OF REQUESTS PER MINUTE
WITH CONSISTENT SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. THE FASTEST
OBJECT STORAGE IN THE CLOUD AND
UP TO TEN TIMES FASTER THAN S3
STANDARD STORAGE. NOW THE FASTER
DATA PROCESSING LETS YOU SAVE UP
TO 60% ON YOUR COMPUTE COSTS AS
WELL. FOR WORKLOADS THAT REQUIRE
THE HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS
AND THE DATA ACCESS COSTS. ALSO
ARE 50% LOWER THAN S3 STANDARD.
SO YOU CAN RUN THESE WORKLOADS
AT MUCH, MUCH LOWER COST. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, WITH S3 EXPRESS, ONE
ZONE, PINTEREST HAS OBSERVED
OVER TEN TIMES FASTER RIDE
SPEEDS WHILE REDUCED THEIR TOTAL
COST BY 40% FOR ITS MACHINE
LEARNING POWERED VISUAL
INSPIRATION ENGINE. NOW THIS IS
ENABLING THEM TO DO FASTER
EXPERIMENTATION AND
PERSONALIZATION, IMPROVING
EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR USERS. SO
17 YEARS AGO, S3 REINVENTED
STORAGE BY LAUNCHING THE FIRST
CLOUD SERVICE FOR AWS AND WITH
S3 EXPRESS, ONE ZONE, YOU CAN
SEE S3 CONTINUING TO CHANGE HOW
DEVELOPERS USE STORAGE. THE SAME
SIMPLE INTERFACE AND SAME LOW
COST. AND NOW? NOW EVEN FASTER.
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
REINVENTION. GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING. SO WE REALIZED ALMOST
TEN YEARS AGO THAT IF WE WANTED
TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE
ON PRICE PERFORMANCE FOR ALL OF
YOUR WORKLOADS, WE HAD TO
REINVENT GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING FOR THE CLOUD ERA ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO THE SILICON AND
IN 2018, WE BECAME THE FIRST
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER TO DEVELOP
OUR OWN GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTE
PROCESSORS. WHEN WE ANNOUNCED
GRAVITON, OUR SERVER PROCESS OR
CHIP AND CUSTOMERS LOVE THE COST
SAVINGS THAT IT DELIVERED FOR
SCALE OUT WORKLOADS LIKE
MICROSERVICES AND WEB
APPLICATIONS, BUT ASKED FOR MORE
. SO WE BROUGHT YOU GRAVITON2,
WHICH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE SEVEN
FOLD FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF
WORKLOADS AND WE DIDN'T STOP
THERE. OUR CURRENT GENERATION.
GRAVITON THREE DELIVER IS UP TO
25. BETTER COMPUTE PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO GRAVITON2 AND THE
BEST PRICE PERFORMANCE IN EC2.
IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO USES 60%
LESS ENERGY FOR THE SAME LEVEL
OF PERFORMANCE AND THIS IS SO,
SO IMPORTANT TO SO MANY
CUSTOMERS TODAY. AND THAT'S
COMPARED TO COMPARABLE EC2
INSTANCES. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY
IS ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE
IMPORTANT. TODAY. WE'VE GOT OVER
150 GRAVITON BASED INSTANCES
ACROSS THE EC2 PORTFOLIO AND
MORE THAN 50,000 CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING ALL OF THE TOP 100 EC2
CUSTOMERS, USE GRAVITON BASED
INSTANCES TO REALIZE PRICE
PERFORMANCE BENEFITS. FOR
EXAMPLE, SAP, THEY'VE PARTNERED
WITH AWS TO ACTUALLY POWER SAP,
HANA CLOUD WITH GRAVITON AND
WITH GRAVITON. SAP HAS SEEN UP
TO 35% BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
FOR ANALYTICS WORKLOADS AND AIMS
TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT
. THEIR CARBON IMPACT BY AN
ESTIMATED 45. SUPER IMPRESSIVE
OF WE ARE RELENTLESS ABOUT
INNOVATION AND WE CONTINUE TO
PUSH THE ENVELOPE FURTHER. SO
TODAY I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THE LATEST GENERATION OF OUR
GRAVITON PROCESSOR AWS GRAVITON.
FOUR GRAVITON FOUR OR GRAVITON
FOUR IS THE MOST POWERFUL AND
THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT CHIP
THAT WE HAVE EVER BUILT, WITH
50% MORE CORES AND 75% MORE
MEMORY BANDWIDTH THAN GRAVITON.
THREE GRAVITON, FOUR CHIPS ARE
30% FASTER ON AVERAGE THAN
GRAVITON. THREE AND PERFORM EVEN
BETTER FOR CERTAIN WORKLOADS,
LIKE 40% FASTER FOR DATABASE
APPLICATIONS AND 45% FASTER FOR
JAVA APPLICATIONS AS WE WERE THE
FIRST TO DEVELOP AND OFFER OUR
OWN SERVER PROCESSORS, WE'RE NOW
IN OUR FOURTH GENERATION. IN
JUST FIVE YEARS. OTHER CLOUD
PROVIDERS HAVE NOT EVEN
DELIVERED ON THEIR FIRST SERVER
PROCESSORS YET. WE'RE ALSO
ANNOUNCING THE PREVIEW OF OUR
FIRST INSTANCE BASED ON GRAVITON
FOUR RAG INSTANCES AS RAG IS
PART OF OUR MEMORY OPTIMIZED
INSTANCE FAMILY. THEY'RE
DESIGNED TO DELIVER FAST, FAST
PERFORMANCE FOR WORKLOADS. THAT
PROCESS LARGE DATA SETS AND
MEMORY LIKE DATABASES OR REAL
TIME BIG DATA ANALYTICS. RAG
INSTANCES PROVIDE THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY
EFFICIENCY FOR MEMORY INTENSIVE
WORKLOADS AND THERE ARE MANY,
MANY MORE GRAVITON. FOUR
INSTANCES COMING HIGHLY RELIABLE
REGIONS WITH AVAILABILITY ZONES
DURABLE, INSTANTLY SCALABLE, LOW
COST STORAGE, LEADING PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITH CUSTOM DESIGNED
CHIPS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW
EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'RE
REINVENTING TO CONSTANTLY
DELIVER WHAT YOU NEED TO DRIVE
YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE, YOUR
INNOVATION, AND YOUR BUSINESSES.
AND FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES WE
HAVE BEEN SO INTENT ON PROVIDING
YOU WITH THE BROADEST AND
DEEPEST FUNCTIONALITY WITH THE
FAST PACE OF INNOVATION, THE
MOST RELIABLE, THE MOST SECURE
CLOUD SERVICES AND OF COURSE THE
LARGEST AND THE MOST DIVERSE
COMMUNITY OF CUSTOMERS AND
PARTNERS. NOW THESE ADVANTAGES
ARE ALWAYS RELEVANT, BUT NO MORE
SO THAN TODAY, BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALSO THE FOUNDATION FOR
REINVENTING WITH GENERATIVE AI I
NOW HERE TO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
THE BROADEST AND DEEPEST
CAPABILITIES, THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY AND
THE PRIVACY YOU TRUST. YOU NEED
AT ALL. AMAZON HAS BEEN
INNOVATING WITH AI FOR DECADES.
WE USE IT ACROSS THE COMPANY TO
OPTIMIZE THINGS LIKE OUR COMPANY
WIDE SUPPLY CHAIN TO CREATE
BETTER RETAIL SEARCH
CAPABILITIES, WIZ TO DELIVER NEW
EXPERIENCES LIKE AMAZON, ALEXA
OR OUR JUST WALK OUT SHOPPING
TECHNOLOGY. GENAI IS THE NEXT
STEP IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,
AND IT IS GOING TO REINVENT
EVERY APPLICATION THAT WE
INTERACT WITH AT WORK AND AT
HOME. WE'RE READY TO HELP YOU
REINVENT WITH GENERATIVE AI
BECAUSE AGAIN, WE THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES
TO MEET YOUR NEEDS AND WE
REINVENT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND
BECAUSE WE'RE INTIMATELY
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT MEANS TO
REINVENT OURSELVES AS WE
UNDERSTAND HOW TO HELP YOU WITH
YOUR REINVENTIONS. FROM STARTUPS
TO ENTERPRISES, ORGANIZATIONS OF
ALL SIZES ARE GETTING GOING WITH
GENERATIVE AI. THEY WANT TO TAKE
THE MOMENTUM THAT THEY'RE
BUILDING WITH EARLY
EXPERIMENTATION AND TURN IT INTO
REAL WORLD PRODUCTIVITY GAINS
AND INNOVATE, INNOVATE,
INNOVATE. SO WE THINK ABOUT
GENERATIVE AI AS HAVING ACTUALLY
THREE MACRO LAYERS, IF YOU WILL,
OF A STACK. AND THEY'RE ALL
EQUALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE ARE
INVESTING IN ALL THREE OF THEM.
SO THE BOTTOM LAYER IS USED TO
TRAIN FOUNDATION MODELS, OTHER
AND LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, FMS,
WE'LL CALL THEM AND TO RUN THESE
MODELS IN PRODUCTION, THE MIDDLE
LAYER PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE LMS
AND OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
YOU NEED AND ALL THE TOOLS THAT
YOU NEED TO BUILD AND SCALE
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
THEM. AND THEN AT THE TOP LAYER,
WE'VE GOT APPLICATIONS THAT ARE
BUILT USING FMS SO THAT YOU CAN
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GENERATIVE AI
QUICKLY WITHOUT EVEN NEEDING ANY
SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE. SO LET'S
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LAYER
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WITH, WITH,
WITH THE FOUNDATION MODELS,
THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF
WORKLOADS TRAINING AND INFERENCE
AND TRAINING IS TO CREATE AND
PROVE FMS BY LEARNING PATTERNS
FROM LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRAINING,
DATA AND INFERENCE. USE THAT TO
RUN THE MODELS IN PRODUCTION TO
GENERATE AN OUTPUT SUCH AS TEXT
OR IMAGES OR VIDEO. AND THESE
WORKLOADS CONSUME MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF COMPUTE POWER. SO TO
MAKE GENAI GENAI USE CASES
ECONOMICAL AND FEASIBLE, ALL YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR TRAINING, YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR INFERENCE ON
INCREDIBLY PERFORMANT, COST
EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR ML AND AI. NOW
GPUS ARE THE CHIPS THAT CAN
PERFORM A HIGH VOLUME OF
MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS,
SIMULTANEOUS ALI MAKING THEM
POPULAR FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT
WORKLOADS FROM ML SIMULATIONS,
3D RENDERING. AND WE'VE BEEN
COLLABORATING WITH NVIDIA FOR
OVER 13 YEARS TO BRING GPUS TO
THE CLOUD BUILT ON COMPUTE
INSTANCES THAT SUPPORT A WIDE
RANGE OF USE CASES, INCLUDING
GRAPH SIX GAMING HPC, MACHINE
LEARNING, AND NOW OF COURSE
DEMAND AND GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS. IN 2010, AWS WAS THE
FIRST TO BRING NVIDIA GPUS TO
THE CLOUD WITH KG ONE OR THE
CLUSTER GPU INSTANCE. THEN WE
WERE THE FIRST TO OFFER NVIDIA V
100 GPUS WITH OUR P THREE
INSTANCES AND THEN WE WERE AGAIN
THE FIRST TO OFFER THE A 100
TENSOR CORE GPUS WITH OUR P FOUR
INSTANCES IN PRODUCTION AND
EARLIER THIS YEAR, YES, WE WERE
THE FIRST MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER
TO BRING NVIDIA H100 GPUS TO
MARKET WITH OUR P FIVE INSTANCES
AND THE P FIVE ARE PROVIDING
AMAZING PERFORMANCE FOR
TRAINING. THEY'RE UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER AND 40% LESS
EXPENSIVE THAN P FOUR SECONDS.
NOW HAVING THE BEST CHIPS IS
GREAT AND NECESSARY, BUT TO
DELIVER THE NEXT LEVEL OF
PERFORMANCE, YOU NEED MORE THAN
JUST THE BEST GPUS. YOU ALSO
NEED REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE
CLUSTERS OF SERVERS THAT ARE
RUNNING THESE GPUS. OUR GPU
INSTANCES CAN BE DEPLOYED IN EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH UP TO 3200
GIGABITS PER SECOND OF
NETWORKING THROUGH OUR ELASTIC
FABRIC ADAPTER OR EFA. AND THIS
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
20,000 GPUS IN A SINGLE CLUSTER
FOR PROVIDING UP TO 20 EXAFLOPS
OF AGGREGATE COMPUTE COMPUTE
CAPACITY, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO
A SUPERCOMPUTER. AND ALL OF OUR
GPU INSTANCES THAT ARE RELEASED
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS ARE BASED
ON OUR BREAKTHROUGH NITRO
SYSTEM, WHICH REINVENT NOTED
VIRTUALIZATION BY OFFLOADING
STORAGE AND NETWORKING TO
SPECIALIZED CHIPS SO THAT ALL OF
THE SERVICE COMPUTE IS DEDICATED
TO RUNNING YOUR WORKLOADS. AND
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT OTHER
CLOUD PROVIDERS CAN OFFER. AGAIN
NOW WITH NITRO THIS DELIVERS
PERFORMANCE INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM BARE METAL, BUT AT A LOWER
PRICE. AND THE NITRO SYSTEM ALSO
PROVIDES ENHANCED SECURITY THAT
CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS AND
PROTECTS AND VERIFIES THAT THE
INSTANCE HARDWARE AND FIRMWARE
ARE ALL ROBUST. WE'VE WORKED
CLOSELY WITH NVIDIA TO INTEGRATE
OUR NETWORKING AND OUR
VIRTUALIZATION CAPABILITIES WITH
THEIR CHIPS TO BRING OUR GPU
INSTANCES TO CUSTOMERS AND TODAY
I'M THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE
ARE EXPANDING OUR PARTNERSHIP
WITH NVIDIA WITH MORE
INNOVATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO
DELIVER THE MOST ADVANCED
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS WITH, WITH WITH GPUS
AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE JENSEN
HUANG, FOUNDER AND CEO OF NVIDIA
HERE ON STAGE WITH US TO TELL US
MORE. KALLEL JENSEN, SO GOOD TO
SEE YOU. I'M THRILLED TO BE
HERE. YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US TODAY. IT'S
AMAZING. SO AS I'VE JUST
DISCUSSED, WE'VE GOT A LONG
PARTNERSHIP. AWS NVIDIA. I'VE
BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME
TOGETHER AND I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT HOW THE TEAMS ARE
COLLABORATING. YOU AND I WERE
TALKING ABOUT THAT BACKSTAGE.
THE COLLABORATION IS AMAZING.
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LOT OF
YEARS AND I'M JUST THRILLED TO
DEEPEN THE PARTNERSHIP. THANK
YOU. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. I'M
THRILLED TO BE HERE TO CELEBRATE
THE AMAZING WORK OF OUR TWO
TEAMS AND TO HELP ANNOUNCE OUR
BIG NEW PARTNERSHIP. YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR
A VERY LONG TIME. IN FACT, AWS
WAS THE WORLD'S FIRST CLOUD TO
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GPU
ACCELERATED COMPUTING. AND YOU
PUT THE WORLD'S FIRST GPUS IN
THE CLOUD A LONG TIME AGO. AND
SINCE THEN, THIS IS AN AMAZING
STATISTIC. SIX IN THE LAST
SEVERAL YEARS ALONE, JUST FOR
THE AMPERE AND HOPPER GENERATION
WE'VE PUT UP DEPLOYED BOYD TO
MILNE, XEON CPUS IN AWS THAT'S
THREE Z FLOPS. 3000 EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER HOURS MOST YEAH
EXACTLY. YEAH MOST NATIONS WILL
BE HAPPY WITH ONE EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER AND AWS HAS 3000
OF THEM AND WE ARE JUST JUST
GETTING STARTED. I'M DELIGHTED
TO SEE THAT WE ARE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE TODAY A DEPLOYMENT OF A
WHOLE NEW FAMILY OF GPUS, THE L4
, THE L4 IS AND THE BRAND NEW H
200, THE H 200. THIS IS REALLY
AMAZING THING. THE COMBINATION
BETWEEN THE BRAND NEW TENSOR LLM
OPTIMIZING COMPILERS FOR
GENERATIVE AI AND H 200 IMPROVES
THE THROUGHPUT OF IN INFERENCE
LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL INFERENCE
BY A FACTOR OF FOUR REDUCING THE
COST IN JUST ONE YEAR BY A
FACTOR OF FOUR. NOW OUR
COLLABORATION STARTS WITH, OF
COURSE GREAT GPUS AND WE'RE
RAMPING SO INCREDIBLY FAST EACH
QUARTER. WE'RE STANDING UP AND
DEPLOYING MORE THAN ONE SET OF
FLOPS. MORE FOR AN AWS ONE XEN
OF FLOPS MORE EACH QUARTER. IT'S
AN UNBELIEVABLE NUMBER AND ALL
OF THIS IS, OF COURSE, MADE
POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE
ACCELERATED COMPUTING LIBRARIES.
OUR TWO TEAMS STOOD UP A WHOLE
BUNCH OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT
WE'RE ALSO BRINGING OUR MOST
POPULAR LIBRARIES, THE NVIDIA,
AI STACK, OUR NEMO LLM LARGE
LANGUAGE MODEL FRAMEWORK. THE
RETRIEVER FOR INFERENCE MODEL
FOR RAGS, OUR BIO NEMO DIGITAL
BIOLOGY, LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
FOUNDATION MODELS. ISAAC SIM ON
OMNIVERSE FOR ROBOTICS. THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT AMAZON ROBOTICS
USES TO SIMULATE ITS ROBOTS AND
ITS INCREDIBLE WAREHOUSES THAT
YOU GUYS DO. JUST ALL OF THESE
STACKS, SOFTWARE STACKS AND
LIBRARIES WE'RE GOING TO
INTEGRATE INTO AWS. SO OUR TWO
TEAMS HAVE BEEN REALLY, REALLY
BUSY. BUSY INDEED. AND THAT WAS
A LOT OF THAT WAS A LOT OF
ZETAS. AND EVERYTHING. YEAH. SO
AS YOU SAID, THE COLLABORATION
IS GOING TO ENABLE DEVELOPERS TO
ACCESS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY AND
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED IT TO
INNOVATE WITH GENERATIVE AI. NOW
THE ONE OF THE BIG
ANNOUNCEMENTS, OF COURSE, IS
THAT AWS IS GOING TO BE THE
FIRST CLOUD PROVIDER TO BRING
THE LATEST NVIDIA 200
GRACE-HOPPER SUPER CHIPS WITH A
NEW MULTI-NODE NVLINK TO THE
CLOUD FIRST PLACE. AND MAYBE YOU
CAN TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT THAT AND WHAT MAKES THAT
COMPUTING PLATFORM SO POWERFUL
AND HOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER
TO INTRODUCE IT. WELL, WE'RE
BOTH REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT ARM
PROCESSORS AND THE REASON WHY
ARM IS SO INCREDIBLE IS BECAUSE
WE CAN WE CAN MOLD IT TO EXACTLY
THE TYPE OF COMPUTING NEEDS THAT
WE HAVE. IT'S INCREDIBLY LOW
ENERGY. IT'S INCREDIBLY COST
EFFECTIVE. AND SO GRACE-HOPPER,
WHICH IS GX 200, CONNECTS TWO
REVOLUTIONARY PROCESSORS
TOGETHER IN A REALLY UNIQUE WAY.
IT CONNECTS THEM TOGETHER USING
A CHIP TO CHIP INTERCONNECT
CALLED NVLINK AT ONE TERABYTE
BYTES PER SECOND, AND IT'S
CONNECTED IN A COHERENT WAY SO
THAT THE GPU CAN ACCESS ALL OF
THE CPU'S MEMORY. THE CPU CAN
ACCESS ALL OF THE GPU'S MEMORY
AND SO THE TWO OF THESE
PROCESSORS COULD WORK HAND IN
HAND IN A REALLY FAST WAY. THE
SECOND THING THAT WE DID WAS WE
INVENTED A NEW WAY OF EXTENDING
NVLINK TO A VERY LARGE DOMAIN.
SO NOW 32 GRACE HOPPERS COULD BE
CONNECTED BY A BRAND NEW NVLINK
SWITCH, AND THAT BECOMES ONE
UNIT. AND WITH THE NITRO AWS
NITRO THAT BECOMES BASICALLY ONE
GIANT VIRTUAL GPU INSTANCE. I
MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE
THIS. YOU'VE GOT 30 2H2
HUNDREDS. INCREDIBLE HORSEPOWER
IN ONE VIRTUAL INSTANCE BECAUSE
OF AWS NITRO. AND THEN WE
CONNECT IT WITH AWS, EFA YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY FAST NETWORKING ING
ALL OF THESE UNITS NOW CAN
CREATE INTO A ULTRA CLUSTER AND
AWS GLUE CLUSTER. SO I CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE ALL THIS COME
TOGETHER. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE COMBINATION.
I MEAN, HOW CUSTOMERS ARE GOING
TO USE THIS STUFF. ONE CAN ONLY
IMAGINE AND I KNOW THAT THE TH
TWO HUNDREDS ARE REALLY GOING TO
SUPERCHARGE WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE
DOING. IT'S GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE OF COURSE, IN EC2
INSTANCES COMING SOON. NOW IN
THE WORLD OF GENERATIVE AI, A
LOT OF COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO,
UH, TO ONBOARD AI INTO THEIR
BUSINESS AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE
THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT IT
EXTENDS TO THE SOFTWARE, THE
SERVICES AND ALL OF THE OTHER
WORKFLOWS THAT THEY HAVE. SO
THIS LEADS OF COURSE, TO THE
SECOND BIG ANNOUNCEMENT WE HAVE
TODAY. SO PARTNERING NVIDIA TO
BRING THE NVIDIA DGX CLOUD TO
AWS AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE DGX
CLOUD IS IMPORTANT PLATFORM FOR
CUSTOMERS. WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
DGX CLOUD IS NVIDIA'S AI
FACTORY. THIS IS HOW OUR
RESEARCHERS ADVANCE AI. WE USE
AI TO DO NEURAL GRAPHICS. THE
WAY WE DO COMPUTER GRAPHICS
TODAY IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT AI.
WE USE AI TO ADVANCE. WE USE OUR
AI FACTORIES TO ADVANCE OUR
DIGITAL BIOLOGY MODELS, OUR
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS USE IT FOR
ROBOTICS, FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS.
WE USE IT TO SIMULATE EARTH, TO
A DIGITAL TWIN OF THE EARTH, TO
PREDICT WEATHER AND CLIMATE. IT
AND SO THE CLOUD IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO US. WE'RE
INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BUILD THE
LARGEST AI FACTORY NVIDIA HAS
EVER BUILT. WE'RE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE INSIDE OUR COMPANY WE
CALL IT PROJECT CIBA CIBA. YOU
ALL PROBABLY KNOW SINCE YOU'RE
AT A CONFERENCE IS THE LARGEST,
MOST MAGNIFICENT TREE IN THE
AMAZON. WE CALL IT PROJECT CIBA.
CIBA IS GOING TO BE 16,000 AND
16,384 GPUS CONNECTED INTO ONE
GIANT AI SUPERCOMPUTER. FOR THIS
IS UTTERLY INCREDIBLE. WE WILL
BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE TRAINING
TIME OF THE LARGEST LANGUAGE
MODELS. THE NEXT GENERATION
MOISES THESE LARGE EXTREMELY
LARGE MIXTURE MIXTURE OF
EXPERTS, MODELS AND BE ABLE TO
TRAIN IT IN JUST HALF OF THE
TIME, ESSENTIALLY REDUCE THE
COST OF TRAINING IN JUST ONE
YEAR IN HALF. NOW WE'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO TRAIN MUCH, MUCH
LARGER MULTI-MODAL MO MODELS
THIS NEXT GENERATION, LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS, THESE 16,000
GPUS WILL BE 65 EXAFLOPS. IT'S
LIKE 65 EXASCALE SUPERCOMPUTERS
IN ONE. AND SO I CAN'T WAIT FOR
US TO STAND THIS UP. OUR AI
RESEARCHERS ARE CHOMPING AT THE
BIT. NOW, OF COURSE, THIS IS
ALSO A PLACE WHERE WE
COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS AND
CUSTOMERS WHO NEED TO BUILD
CUSTOM AI MODELS. YOU KNOW, IT'S
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO USE OFF THE
SHELF MODELS AND THERE'S BE A
WHOLE BUNCH OF OFF THE SHELF
MODELS IN PUBLIC CLOUDS. IT'S
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN A
SOFTWARE PLATFORM. COMPANIES,
SAAS COMPANIES, FOR EXAMPLE,
SALESFORCE THAT YOU MENTIONED
EARLIER, THEY'LL HAVE ALL KINDS
OF OFF THE SHELF COPILOTS AND
GENERATIVE AI MODELS. BUT A LOT
OF COMPANIES NEED TO BUILD THEIR
OWN PROPRIETARY MODELS. AND SO
WE SET UP THE AI FACTORY. SO
THAT WE COULD PARTNER WITH THEM
TO HELP THEM CREATE THEIR CUSTOM
AIS, AND NOW THEY'LL RUN ALL ON
AWS. WE'LL DEVELOP THE MODEL ON
AWS, COLLABORATE WITH OUR
CUSTOMERS ON AWS, CONNECT THEM
ALL TO YOUR SERVICES AND STORAGE
SERVICES, SECURITY SERVICES AND
ALL KINDS OF OTHER GENERATIVE AI
SERVICES AND THEN DEPLOY IT ALL
IN AWS. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO DO THIS VERY FIRST TIME
IN AWS. IT'S ALL AMAZING. I
MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING
AMAZING THINGS. WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD TO SEE US COME
TOGETHER EVEN MORE TIGHTLY. I
MEAN, IT'S JUST GOING TO BRING
INCREDIBLE BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS
WHO ARE REALLY GOING TO NEED IT.
WE APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION,
APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU AND
LOOK FORWARD TO A LOT MORE OF
THAT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU,
ADAM. THANK YOU. JENSEN. HAVE A
GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. IT'S BEEN
A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. WE REALLY
APPRECIATED IT. NOW LET'S TALK
ABOUT CAPACITY OR ACTUALLY
GETTING ACCESS TO ALL OF THAT
AMAZING COMPUTE. SO CUSTOMERS
WHO WANT TO BUILD AND TRAIN
MODELS OFTEN NEED LARGE AMOUNTS
OF RELIABLE CLUSTERED CAPACITY.
IT HAS TO BE TOGETHER OR IN
CLUSTERS, BUT THEY DON'T
NECESSARILY NEED THE SAME AMOUNT
OF IT ALL THE TIME.
FOR EXAMPLE, CUSTOMERS TRAINING A MODEL. I
MEAN, THEY MIGHT STOP TO
EVALUATE NEWS, USE NEW TRAINING
DATA OR MAKE OTHER CHANGES, AND
THEN THEY WANT TO DO MORE
TRAINING. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS
THAT THEY OFTEN NEED SHORT TERM
CLUSTERED CAPACITY AND IT'S
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NO ONE, NO
CLOUD HAS BEEN ADDRESSING UNTIL
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
FOR ML AND EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
WERE THE FIRST CONSUMPTION MODEL
IN THE INDUSTRY THAT ENABLES ANY
CUSTOMER TO RESERVE THE HIGHLY
SOUGHT AFTER GPU CAPACITY TO RUN
FOR SHORT DURATION MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS. AND THIS
ELIMINATES THE NEED TO HOLD ON
TO THE CAPACITY HOLDING CAPACITY
THAT THEY'RE USING JUST SO THEY
CAN BE CERTAIN THAT THEY CAN USE
IT LATER IF THEY NEED TO USE IT
LATER. NOW EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
ARE DEPLOYED IN ULTRACLUSTERS
INTERCONNECTED WITH OUR EFA
NETWORKING THAT WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THIS MORNING AND THAT
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
HUNDREDS OF GPUS IN A SINGLE
CLUSTER WITH THIS NEW OFFERING.
SO WITH THE CAPACITY BLOCKS,
CUSTOMERS CAN PLAN FOR THEIR ML
WORKLOAD DEPLOYMENTS WITH
CERTAINTY AND THEY KNOW THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE GPU
CAPACITY WHEN THEY NEED IT AND
ONLY WHEN THEY NEED IT. NOW
SUPPORT FOR THE LATEST
GENERATION. HIGH PERFORMANCE
GPUS COMBINED WITH OUR
INNOVATIONS, VIRTUALIZATION,
NETWORKING, CLUSTER MANAGEMENT.
THESE ARE REASONS WHY AWS IS THE
BEST PLACE TO RUN GPUS IN THE
WORLD, BUT TO DRIVE INNOVATION
AND THE BROAD CHOICES THAT OUR
CUSTOMERS WANT IN ML AND AI, WE
REALIZED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT
AGAIN HERE IS ANOTHER PLACE WE'D
HAVE TO INNOVATE ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO THE SILICON, JUST LIKE
WE DID WITH GRAVITON FOR GENERAL
PURPOSE COMPUTING AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT TRAINIUM AND INFERENTIA
. SO TRAINIUM IS OUR PURPOSE
BUILT CHIP FOR TRAINING, MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS, MACHINE
LEARNING MODELS AND INFERENTIA
IS OUR CHIP OPTIMIZED FOR
RUNNING INFERENCE ON THOSE
MODELS? SO EARLIER THIS YEAR WE
ALREADY ANNOUNCED THE SECOND
GENERATION OF OUR INFERENTIA
CHIP INFERENTIA TO AND BECAUSE
WE OPTIMIZE FOR INFERENCE, THE
TWO INSTANCES POWERED BY
INFERENTIA TO ARE OFFER THE BEST
LOWEST COST INFERENCE IN EC2
WHILE ALSO DELIVERING UP TO FOUR
TIMES HIGHER THROUGHPUT AND TEN
TIMES LOWER LATENCY COMPARED TO
THE INF1 INSTANCES. CUSTOMERS
LIKE ADOBE, DEUTSCHE TELEKOM,
LEONARDO, AI, THEY'VE ALL SEEN
GREAT EARLY RESULTS AND THEY ARE
DEPLOYING THEIR GENERATIVE AI AI
MODELS AT SCALE WITH INFERENTIA
TO. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF
INTEREST IN TRAINIUM AS WELL.
OUR TRN1 INSTANCES POWERED BY
TRAINIUM HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED BY A
LOT OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
ANTHROPIC PARTNERS LIKE
DATABRICKS AND RICOH AND OUR OWN
AMAZON SEARCH TEAM USES TRN1
INSTANCES TO TRAIN TRAIN A
LARGE, DEEP, LARGE SCALE, DEEP
LEARNING MODELS. THEY'RE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF A TRAINIUM HIGH
PERFORMANCE SCALE RELIABILITY
AND LOW COST. BUT AS CUSTOMERS
CONTINUE TO TRAIN BIGGER AND
BIGGER MODELS ON LARGER AND
LARGER DATA SETS, WE REALIZED WE
NEEDED TO KEEP PUSHING AND
PUSHING OUR PRICE PERFORMANCE.
WE'RE NEVER DONE THERE. AND
TODAY I'M REALLY EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE AWS TRAINIUM TO OUR
SECOND GENERATION. IT'S OUR
SECOND GENERATION CHIP. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR HIGH
PERFORMANCE TRAINING OF
FOUNDATION MODELS, TRAINING IS
DESIGNED TO DELIVER UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO OUR FIRST GENERATION
CHIPS AND THAT MAKES IT IDEAL
FOR TRAINING FOUNDATION MODELS
WITH HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OR
EVEN TRILLIONS OF PARAMETERS.
TRAINIUM TWO IS GOING TO POWER
THE NEXT GENERATION OF EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND WILL DELIVER
UP TO 65 EXAFLOPS OF AGGREGATE
COMPUTE AND WE EXPECT THE FIRST
TRAINIUM TWO BASED INSTANCES ARE
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR
AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO DO
WITH THEM. MEANWHILE ALL A LOT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS ARE
STILL JUST TALKING ABOUT THEIR
OWN. ML CHIPS. WE'VE ALSO MADE A
LOT OF EXCITING PROGRESS IN
BUILDING THE SOFTWARE TOOLCHAIN
THAT SUPPORTS TRAINIUM IN
INFERENTIA. SO AWS NEURON IS OUR
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT THAT
HELPS CUSTOMERS GET MAXIMUM
PERFORMANCE FROM ML CHIPS. NEW
RON SUPPORTS MACHINE LEARNING
FRAMEWORKS LIKE TENSORFLOW
PYTORCH WITH JAX SUPPORT COMING
REALLY SOON AND SO CUSTOMERS CAN
USE THEIR EXISTING KNOWLEDGE TO
BUILD TRAINING AND INFERENCE
PIPELINES WITH JUST A FEW LINES
OF CODE AND NEURON SUPPORTS THE
MOST POPULAR MODELS, INCLUDING
93 OF THE TOP 100 AND COUNTING.
IMPORTANTLY, YOU ALSO NEED THE
RIGHT TOOLS TO HELP TRAIN AND
DEPLOY YOUR MODELS AND THIS IS
WHY WE HAVE AMAZON SAGEMAKER OUR
MANAGED SERVICE. THAT MAKES IT
EASY FOR DEVELOPERS TO TRAIN,
TUNE, BUILD, MANAGE MACHINE
LEARNING AND FOUNDATION MODELS.
IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE WE
LAUNCHED SAGEMAKER, WE'VE
INTRODUCED A LOT OF POWERFUL
INNOVATIONS LIKE AUTOML MODEL
TUNING, DISTRIBUTED TRAINING,
FLEXIBLE MODEL DEPLOYMENT TOOLS
FOR ML OPS AND BUILT IN FEATURES
LIKE RESPONSIBLE AI. SAGEMAKER
HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN
DEMOCRATIZING ML FOR TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING STABILITY AI AI21LABS
LABS, THOMSON REUTERS,
ASTRAZENECA, 3M, HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AWS,
FERRARI AND MORE, AND SAGEMAKER
CAN TRAIN MODELS WITH UP TO
BILLIONS OF PARAMETERS FOR
EXAMPLE, TI HAS TRAINED 180
BILLION PARAMETER FALCON FM,
WHICH IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MODEL ON
SAGEMAKER USING 3000 GPUS AND
PETABYTES OF PETABYTES OF DATA
STORED IN S3. AND YOU CAN ALSO
DEPLOY THIS TOP RANKED MODEL
USING SAGEMAKER. WE'VE ALSO BEEN
WORKING CLOSELY WITH HUGGINGFACE
TO SUPPORT THEIR MODELS ON
SAGEMAKER AND HAVE COLLABORATED
TO CREATE THE HUGGING FACE DEEP
LEARNING CONTAINERS TO HELP
ACCELERATE TRAINING AND
DEPLOYMENT OF FMS USING
SAGEMAKER, TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA. SO IF YOU'RE
BUILDING YOUR OWN MODELS. AWS IS
RELENTLESSLY FOCUSED ON
EVERYTHING YOU NEED THE BEST
CHIPS, THE MOST ADVANCED
VIRTUALIZATION, POWERFUL
PETABYTE SCALE NETWORKING
CAPABILITIES, HYPER SCALE
CLUSTERING AND THE RIGHT TOOLS
TO HELP YOU BUILD. BUT OF
COURSE, AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF
ORGANIZATIONS JUST WANT TO BE
ABLE TO ACCESS THE MOST POWERFUL
MODELS OUT THERE. THEY WANT TO
GET STARTED QUICKLY,
EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT FMS
AND TESTING DIFFERENT USE CASES
AND TO MEET THE ENORMOUS
OPPORTUNITY HEAD ON. BUT THEY
ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH
MODEL SHOULD I EVEN USE AND HOW
DO I DECIDE WHICH ARE BEST FOR
MY APPLICATION? TITAN HOW CAN I
MOVE QUICKLY TO BUILD AND DEPLOY
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS? JENS
AND HOW CAN I KEEP MY DATA
SECURE AND PRIVATE? THAT'S WHY
WE'RE INVESTING IN THAT MIDDLE
LAYER OF THE STACK. SO NOW WE
KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU NEED IT TO
BE EASIER TO ACCESS A POWERFUL
AND DIVERSE SET OF MODELS. LMS
OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS, AND
THEN TO QUICKLY BUILD
APPLICATIONS WITH THEM ALL THE
TIME, MAINTAINING YOUR SECURITY
AND PRIVACY AND THAT'S WHY WE
BUILT AMAZON BEDROCK SO BEDROCK
IS THE EASIEST WAY TO BUILD AND
SCALE GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS
FOR LMS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS AND CUSTOMERS IN EVERY
INDUSTRY ARE ALREADY USING
BEDROCK TO REINVENT THEIR USER
EXPERIENCES, THEIR PRODUCTS AND
THEIR PROCESSES, AND TO BRING AI
INTO THE HEART OF THEIR
BUSINESSES. SO WHY BEDROCK? SO
FIRST, YOU ENJOY THE BROADEST
CHOICE OF MODELS, MANY OF WHICH
ARE AVAILABLE FIRST OR IN SOME
CASES ONLY ON BEDROCK YOU CAN
ADD YOUR OWN BUSINESS CONTEXT
QUICKLY, EASILY AND PRIVATELY
WITH THE BROADEST SELECTION OF
CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS AND YOU
GET ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
AND PRIVACY. BECAUSE WE DESIGNED
IT THAT WAY FROM DAY ONE. AND
THE CUSTOMER EXCITEMENT HAS BEEN
OVERWHELMING. WE MADE THE
SERVICE GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN
SEPTEMBER AND NOW OVER 10,000
CUSTOMERS ARE USING BEDROCK
AROUND THE WORLD ACROSS
VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY, ADIDAS
HAS ENABLING DEVELOPERS TO GET
QUICK, ACCURATE ANSWERS TO DEEP
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, AS CARRIER
IS USING BEDROCK TO COMBINE
HISTORICAL ACTIONS, PREDICTIVE
ANALYTICS SYSTEMS, ALERTS AND
DATA TRENDS TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THESE ARE
HELPING CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR
ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CUT
CARBON EMISSIONS. NASDAQ IS
USING BEDROCK TO AUTOMATE
INVESTIGATIVE WORKFLOWS ON
SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS AND TO
STRENGTHEN THEIR ANTI ANTI
FINANCIAL CRIME AND SURVEILLANCE
CAPABILITIES. SO MANY MORE,
INCLUDING BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES, CLARIANT COX
AUTOMOTIVE, GODADDY. LEXISNEXIS.
MERCK OMNICOM GROUP ARE ALL
USING BEDROCK. THEY'RE ALL USING
IT TO BUILD GENAI APPLICATIONS.
TODAY BUT IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS.
EVERY ONE IS MOVING FAST,
EXPERIMENTING AND LEARNING. AND
AT THE SAME TIME, THE GENERATIVE
AI TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IS EVOLVING
QUICKLY WITH NEW DEVELOPMENTS
PRACTICALLY EVERY DAY AND
CUSTOMERS ARE FINDING THAT
DIFFERENT MODELS ACTUALLY WORK
BETTER FOR DIFFERENT USE CASES
OR ON DIFFERENT SETS OF DATA.
SOME MODELS ARE GREAT FOR
SUMMARIZATION, OTHERS ARE GOOD
FOR REASONING AND INTEGRATION,
AND STILL OTHERS HAVE AWESOME
LANGUAGE SUPPORT. AND THEN
THERE'S IMAGE GENERATION IN
SEARCH USE CASES AND MORE, ALL
COMING FROM BOTH PROPRIETARY
MODELS AND MODELS THAT ARE
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY.
I MEAN, THINGS ARE MOVING SO
FAST AND IN THAT TYPE OF
ENVIRONMENT THAT THE ABILITY TO
ADAPT IS THE MOST VALUABLE
CAPABILITY THAT YOU CAN HAVE.
THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE
MODEL TO RULE THEM ALL, AND
THERE'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE ONE COMPANY PROVIDING THE
MODELS THAT EVERYBODY USES. SO
YOU DON'T WANT A CLOUD PROVIDER
WHO'S BEHOLDEN PRIMARILY TO ONE
MODEL PROVIDER. YOU NEED TO BE
TRYING OUT DIFFERENT MODELS. YOU
NEED TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH
BETWEEN THEM RAPIDLY OR EVEN
COMBINING THEM WITH THE SAME USE
CASES. AND YOU NEED A REAL
CHOICE OF MODEL PROVIDERS AS YOU
DECIDE WHO'S GOT THE BEST
TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO WHO HAS THE
DEPENDABILITY THAT YOU NEED IN A
BUSINESS PARTNER. I THINK THE
EVENTS OF THE PAST TEN DAYS HAVE
MADE THAT VERY CLEAR. WE'VE BEEN
CONSISTENT ABOUT THIS NEED FOR
CHOICE FOR THE WHOLE HISTORY OF
AWS, AND THAT'S THE APPROACH
THAT WE CLEARLY LAID OUT WHEN WE
STARTED TALKING ABOUT OUR
GENERATIVE AI STRATEGY ALMOST A
YEAR AGO. AND THAT'S WHY WE
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE, TO MAKE
BUILDING AND MOVING BETWEEN A
RANGE OF FOUNDATION MODELS AS
EASY AS AN API CALL. TODAY
BEDROCK PROVIDES ACCESS TO A
WIDE RANGE OF MODELS FROM
LEADERS LIKE I. 21 ANTHROPIC
COHERE STABILITY AI, AS WELL AS
AMAZON'S OWN AMAZON TITAN MODELS
. BUT WE DIDN'T STOP THERE. WE
WERE THE FIRST TO MAKE METIS
LLAMA 2 MODEL AVAILABLE THROUGH
A FULLY MANAGED API. AND WE ALSO
RECENTLY ANNOUNCED OUR EXPANDED
COLLABORATION WITH ANTHROPIC. SO
ANTHROPIC IS A LONG TIME AWS
CUSTOMER AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S
LEADING FOUNDATION MODEL
PROVIDERS. THEIR MODELS CLAUDE
AND THEY GOT OTHERS AS WELL
EXCEL AT A WIDE RANGE OF TASKS
FROM SOPHISTICATED DIALOG AND
CREATIVE CONTENT GENERATION TO
COMPLEX REASONING AND DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS. SO AS PART OF THE
COLLABORATION, ANTHROPIC IS
GOING TO USE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA TO TRAIN FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF THEIR MODELS AND
BEDROCK CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO
HAVE EARLY ACCESS, NOT AVAILABLE
ON OTHER CLOUDS TO UNIQUE
FEATURES FOR MODEL CUSTOMIZATION
AND FINE TUNING CAPABILITIES. SO
TO DIG IN ON WHAT WE'RE DOING
WITH ANTHROPIC, I'D LIKE TO
BRING OUT OUR PARTNER DARIO
OMODEI, WHO'S THE CEO AND
CO-FOUNDER OF ANTHROPIC. LET'S
GIVE HIM A HAND. AS WELL. ALL
RIGHT. WE HAVE CHAIRS. LET'S SIT
. DARIO THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. YEAH.
EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
CLAUDE IS AVAILABLE ON BEDROCK,
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT,
LET'S JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS ABOUT
AND WHAT MAKES CLAUDE SO UNIQUE.
YES SO ANTHROPIC WAS FOUNDED ON
THE IDEA THAT WE CAN MAKE AI
MODELS THAT ARE SAFE, RELIABLE
AND STEERABLE WHILE STILL BEING
HIGHLY CAPABLE. THE FOUNDERS OF
ANTHROPIC WERE A SET OF PEOPLE
WHO WORKED AT OPENAI FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. WE DEVELOPED IDEAS LIKE
GPT THREE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK, SCALING
LAWS FOR LANGUAGE MODELS. SOME
OF THE KEY IDEAS BEHIND THE
CURRENT GENERATIVE AI BOOM.
SEVEN OF US LEFT AND FOUNDED
ANTHROPIC, OUR FOUNDATION MODEL
CLAUDE. IN ADDITION TO BEING
SAFE AND RELIABLE, EXCELS AT A
LOT OF KNOWLEDGE WORK TASKS LIKE
CONTENT, GENERATION,
SUMMARIZATION, Q&A, COMPLEX
REASONING, THINGS LIKE THAT. WE
HAVE AN INDUSTRY LEADING CONTEXT
WINDOW OF 200 K TOKENS. THAT'S
ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH MAKES
IT WELL SUITED FOR AREAS LIKE
LEGAL FINANCE, INSURANCE,
CODING, THINGS LIKE THAT. AND
ABOUT HALF OF THE FORTUNE 500
ARE USING OR ARE TESTING CLAUDE.
SO AMAZING PROGRESS. SO JUST A
FEW MONTHS AGO, OBVIOUSLY AMAZON
AND ANTHROPIC ANNOUNCED KIND OF
AN ENHANCED STRATEGIC
COLLABORATION ANTHROPIC NAMED
AWS IS YOUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO
BE TRAINING AND DEPLOYING FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF CLAUDE AND
FOUNDATION MODELS ON AWS. SO
JUST TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT LED
UP TO THIS AND HOW THAT
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANTHROPIC
AND AWS GROW? YEAH. SO ANTHROPIC
USE OF AWS GOES BACK TO OUR
EARLY HISTORY BACK ALL THE WAY
IN THE MIDST OF TIME IN 2021. WE
CAN REMEMBER THAT, RIGHT? WE
TRAINED OUR FIRST. WE TRAINED
OUR FIRST MODEL ON AWS. AND SO
WE'RE EXCITED NOW TO SAY THAT
YOU GUYS ARE OUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS. I WOULD SAY THE
PARTNERSHIP HAS THREE
COMPONENTS. FIRST IS THE COMPUTE
SIDE, WHICH I JUST DISCUSSED,
WHICH WE'VE BEEN DOING
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY. THE SECOND IS ON THE
PROVISION TO CUSTOMER SIDE.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT
AMAZON BEDROCK WE REALLY
RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THAT WE
COULD PROVIDE TO CUSTOMERS
WORKING TOGETHER AND THE THIRD
SIDE IS THE HARDWARE. WE'RE
CURRENTLY WORKING WITH YOU GUYS
TO OPTIMIZE THESE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA FOR OUR USE CASES AND
HOPEFULLY FOR OTHER USE CASES.
AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE
CAN ACHIEVE THAT FOREX FASTER
THAN THE FIRST GENERATION
TRAINIUM THAT YOU JUST
ANNOUNCED. IF WE OPTIMIZE THESE
THINGS TOGETHER. AND SO PUTTING
TOGETHER THESE THREE PIECES,
LAYERS OF THE STACK REALLY
ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE THINGS TO
CUSTOMERS TOGETHER THAT COULDN'T
BE PROVIDED BEFORE THINGS LIKE
CUSTOMIZATION OF MODELS USE OF
PROPRIETARY DATA AND UNIQUE FINE
TUNING FEATURES. WELL, IT'S THE
RESPECT WE HAVE FOR YOU GUYS IS
JUST TREMENDOUS. I MEAN, TRULY
WORLD CLASS EXPERTISE FOR THE
ANTHROPIC TEAM. I'VE REALLY
ENJOYED WORKING TOGETHER AND THE
MODELS ARE JUST SO POWERFUL. SO
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE AIMING TO AND I
THINK WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
IMPROVING AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES THROUGH
THIS COLLABORATION. TITAN AND OF
COURSE OUR OWN AMAZON DEVELOPERS
ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO ANTHROPIC
MODELS ON BEDROCK AND THROUGHOUT
THE COMPANY. AND WE'RE NOT ONLY
WORKING TO PROVIDE HOOD
CUSTOMERS WITH, WITH, WITH THIS,
BUT WE'RE GIVING THEM EARLY
ACCESS TO UNIQUE FEATURES THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
GET ANYWHERE ELSE. AND WE'RE OUT
THERE TOGETHER WITH OUR
GENERATIVE AI INNOVATION CENTER,
WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE
FIELD, HELPING THEM TO ACTUALLY
GET GET TARGETED. AND THAT'S
ALLOWING US, OF COURSE, TO BRING
THIS EXPERTISE AND THE DOMAIN
SPECIFIC EXPERTISE THAT THEY
NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS.
AND AS WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE
TOGETHER AND IT'S BEEN HOT AND
HEAVY, PARTICULARLY THE PAST FEW
WEEKS, BUT BEFORE THAT AS WELL,
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST
INTERESTING USE CASES THAT
YOU'VE SEEN? YEAH SO I'LL GIVE
THREE EXAMPLES ACROSS DIFFERENT
INDUSTRIES. THERE'S MANY OTHERS,
BUT THIS SHOULD GIVE GIVE A
SENSE OF THE RANGE. AND WE WE'VE
SEEN A LOT OF ORGANIC ADOPTION.
ONE EXAMPLE IN THE BIOMEDICAL
SPACE WE'RE HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE
WE'RE WORKING WITH PFIZER. I'M A
FORMER BIOLOGIST MYSELF, SO I'M
REALLY EXCITED FOR ANY WAY I CAN
CAN ADVANCE MEDICAL SCIENCE AND
BRING BRING LIFE SAVING DRUGS TO
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND THE
LEGAL SPACE. WE MADE A CUSTOM
FINE TUNED MODEL, DEPLOYED IT TO
YOU GUYS FOR LEXISNEXIS TO HELP
WITH THEIR LEGAL SEARCH. YOU
KNOW, IN A WAY THAT'S KIND OF
FACT BASED AND PRODUCE CITATIONS
. AND IN THE FINANCE SPACE,
WE'RE WORKING WITH BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES TO DEVELOP AN
INVESTMENT ANALYST, ASSISTANT.
BUT BEYOND THAT, JUST SOME
EXAMPLES. WE'VE ENGAGED WITH
SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF SOME OF THE
LARGEST PLAYERS IN THE INSURANCE
AND BANKING INDUSTRIES AND, YOU
KNOW, COULD TELL SIMILAR STORIES
ABOUT OTHER INDUSTRIES. SO, YOU
KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE
NEW USE CASES AND WHERE ALL OF
THIS GOES. THAT'S INCREDIBLE
MOMENTUM. JUST THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES EXAMPLE TO BE WORKING
WITH WITH THAT MANY LEADERS. SO
JUST LAST WEEK YOU'RE NOT
STANDING STILL, RIGHT. SO JUST
LAST WEEK YOU ANNOUNCED CLAUDE
2.1. SO THAT'S GOT A WHOLE LOT
OF NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN KEY
CAPABLE CITIES. MAYBE YOU CAN
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.
YEAH. SO CLAUDE 2.1 REALLY IS A
RELEASE THAT'S TARGETED AT
ENTERPRISES. SO A FEW DIFFERENT
FEATURES. ONE IS WE'VE DOUBLED
OUR CONTEXT WINDOW TO 200,000
TOKENS. TOKENS IS A TERM OF ART
IN THE AI SPACE. WHAT IT AMOUNTS
TO IS ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH
IS A RELATIVELY LONG BOOK. AND
SO USE CASES LIKE READING
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, READING AN
ENTIRE LONG BOOK. AND ONE OF MY
FAVORITES, PUTTING MULTIPLE
DOCUMENTS IN THE CONTEXT WINDOW
AND ASKING THE MODEL TO COMPARE
THEM OR INTEGRATE THEM. A SECOND
FEATURE IS THAT WE'VE REDUCED
THE RATE OF SO-CALLED
HALLUCINATIONS, WHICH IS WHEN
MODELS SAY THINGS THAT AREN'T
TRUE TO BY BY ABOUT TWO X WE'VE
SEEN ACROSS THE INDUSTRY A CORE
OBSTACLE TO DEPLOYMENT IN THE
ENTERPRISE WORLD IS PEOPLE ARE
WORRIED THAT MODELS WILL SAY
THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE. NO ONE
HAS PERFECTLY SOLVED THIS
PROBLEM, BUT WE ARE REALLY
LEADING THE WAY IN GETTING MORE
AND MORE REDUCTIONS AND THEN WE
ALSO HAVE SOME BETA FEATURES AS
WE'RE INTRODUCING SYSTEM PROMPTS
FOR TOOL USE AS A BETA FEATURE
AND A DEVELOPER WORKBENCH.
AGAIN, ALL TOOLS TARGETED AT
PEOPLE BUILDING FOR ENTERPRISES.
WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE ALL THE USE
CASES THAT EMERGE FROM THIS. I'M
SPEECHLESS. YES, THAT IS SUCH
INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. YES. I
MEAN, YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU
TALKED ABOUT THE REDUCTION OF
HALLUCINATION, A REALLY
IMPORTANT TOPIC. YOU JUST MORE
BROADLY, I THINK WE SHARE A
BELIEF THAT I SHOULD BE SAFE,
SECURE, RESPONSIBLE AND BENEFIT
SOCIETY. AND WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED
A LOT OF GROUPS AND
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROMOTING
THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT
OF RESPONSIBLE AI IN FACT, I
KEEP BUMPING INTO DARIA AROUND
THE WORLD AT SOME OF THESE
VARIOUS GATHERINGS, WHICH IS
NICE. SO I KNOW THIS IS A
PARTICULAR PASSION OF YOURS. AND
CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT ANTHROPIC WORK IN
THIS AREA? YEAH I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING WE
WERE FOUNDED ON AND THAT WE CARE
ABOUT DEEPLY. WE I WOULD
CATEGORIZE IT INTO TWO AREAS
WHERE WE'VE DONE WORK IN THIS
AREA. ONE IS THE WAY WE DESIGN
OUR OWN MODELS AND THE OTHER IS
THE WAY THAT WE TRY TO SET AN
EXAMPLE FOR THE ECOSYSTEM AND
BRING OTHERS ALONG SO THAT
ULTIMATELY EVERYONE BECOMES
SAFER AND MORE RELIABLE. SO
LARGE FRACTION ON THE FIRST ONE,
A LARGE FRACTION OF OUR RESEARCH
ORG WORKS ON SAFETY. WE PUT A
LOT OF WORK INTO MAKING OUR
MODELS HARD TO BREAK, MAKING
THEM SECURE AGAINST MISUSE AND
HARMFUL USE. THERE WAS A RECENT
STUDY OUT OF CARNEGIE MELLON
WHERE PEOPLE TRIED TO
ADVERSARIALLY BREAK DIFFERENT
MODELS AND IT FOUND THAT THEY
WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY BREAK
CLAUDE TEN TIMES LESS OFTEN THAN
THEY WERE ABLE TO BREAK THE
COMPETITOR'S MODEL. SO THERE'S A
REAL DIFFERENCE HERE. A SECOND
WE'VE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO
INTERPRETABILITY SEEING INSIDE
THE MODELS. THERE'S NO
COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENTS ON THAT
SO FAR. BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG ARC
AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT RELATIVELY
SOON FOR BOTH COMPLIANCE AND FOR
UNDERSTANDING WHAT MODELS DO AND
THEREFORE REDUCING BAD BEHAVIOR
FROM THE MODELS, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE
WIDER ECOSYSTEM. YOU KNOW, WE
ALWAYS TRY TO CREATE A RACE TO
THE TOP, DO SOMETHING, AND THEN
COMPETITORS, OTHER PLAYERS IN
THE ECOSYSTEM, FOLLOW ALONG AND
DO THE SAME THING. AN EXAMPLE OF
THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE SCALING
POLICY WHERE WE FRONT LOADED
SAFETY INVESTMENT AHEAD OF MODEL
SCALING, A KIND OF
PRE-DEPLOYMENT TESTING REGIME
LIKE WHAT'S DONE FOR CARS AND
AIRPLANES. AND IN THE POLICY
SPACE, WE'VE CONTINUALLY
ADVOCATED FOR GOVERNMENTS TO
BUILD UP THEIR ABILITY TO
EVALUATE AND MEASURE AI SYSTEMS
AS IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO EVALUATE
AND MEASURE THINGS, WE'LL GET
EITHER NO REGULATION OR POORLY
INFORMED REGULATION. WE NEED TO
ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE CAN DEVELOP QUICKLY,
RESPONSIBLY, BUT IN A WAY THAT'S
SECURE. I JUST LOVE THE CONCEPT
OF THE RACE TO THE TOP. IT'S SO
POSITIVE. AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS SO AMAZING. I MEAN, WE'VE
SAID IT THE WHOLE 17 YEARS THAT
AWS HAS BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES
THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT GIVES US
ENERGY IS JUST WORKING WITH THE
COOLEST, MOST CUTTING EDGE, YOU
KNOW, STARTUPS AND ENTREPRENEURS
IN THE WORLD. AND THERE IS JUST
NO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN GENERATIVE AI NOW.
AND WHAT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS
DOING. SO IT'S GREAT TO BE
PARTNERING TOGETHER SO DEEPLY
AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
JOINING ME HERE ON STAGE TODAY.
YEAH, EXCITED FOR EVERYTHING WE
CAN DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU. ALL
RIGHT.
ALL RIGHTY. SO THAT'S AMAZING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN, DARIA,
FOR COMING OUT AND JOINING US.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. SO THE
INNOVATION AROUND GENERATIVE AI
MODELS IS EXPLOSIVE AND WE
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
WITH ALL OF OUR BEDROCK PARTNERS
FOR YEARS TO COME. INCREDIBLY
INNOVATIVE SPACE. AND WE'RE ALSO
EXCITED ABOUT THE LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS THAT WE'RE BUILDING
OURSELVES AT AMAZON SO OUR
AMAZON TITAN MODELS WERE CREATED
AND PRE-TRAINED BY AWS, AND
WE'RE BUILDING OUR OWN MODELS IN
ORDER TO BRING ACTUALLY A FEW
BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS. SO WE DO
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE HERE. I
MEAN, AMAZON HAS BEEN WORKING ON
AI FOR 25 YEARS. I'VE GOT A LONG
TRACK RECORD. WE USE THE
TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR BUSINESS
AND WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
BUILDING AND DEPLOYING MODELS.
AND AS A RESULT, WE CAN PROVIDE
A WHOLE RANGE OF MODELS THAT
OFFER REALLY POWERFUL
CAPABILITIES AND ALSO GREAT
ECONOMICS TO SUPPORT A WHOLE
BUNCH OF USE CASES AND WE
CAREFULLY CHOOSE HOW WE TRAIN
OUR MODELS AND THE DATA THAT WE
USE TO DO SO. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY
GOING TO INDEMNIFY CUSTOMERS
AGAINST CLAIMS THAT OUR MODELS
OR THEIR OUTPUTS INFRINGE ON
ANYBODY'S COPYRIGHT. NOW, THERE
ARE ALREADY MULTIPLE MODELS IN
THE TITAN FAMILY. WE'VE GOT
TITAN TEXT LITE, WHICH IS IDEAL
FOR TEXT BASED TASKS LIKE
SUMMARIZATION. WE'VE ALSO GOT
TITAN TEXT EXPRESS, WHICH IS
GREAT FOR MORE ADVANCED GENERAL
LANGUAGE TASKS LIKE COPY
EDITING, COPYWRITING AND WE'VE
ALSO GOT THE TITAN TEXT
EMBEDDINGS MODEL FOR SEARCH USE
CASES OR PERSONALIZATION AND
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ADDING
MODELS TO THE TITAN FAMILY. AND
IF YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT, THEN
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TUNE INTO
SWAMI'S KEYNOTE TOMORROW. A
LITTLE, LITTLE WORD UP NOW, ALL
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE
ALL EXTREMELY CAPABLE AND THEY
ALL ENABLE A LOT OF GREAT
APPLICATIONS. BUT TO REALLY
DRIVE YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED
GENERATIVE AI THAT UNDERSTANDS
YOUR BUSINESS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
CUSTOMERS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
PRODUCTS, YOUR OPERATIONS. AND
THAT'S ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN YOU
USE YOUR OWN DATA TO IMPROVE AND
CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS. THE MODELS
HAVE TO BECOME UNIQUE TO YOU. SO
AMAZON BEDROCK IS GIVING YOU ALL
OF THE PURPOSE BUILT
CAPABILITIES THAT YOU NEED TO
CUSTOMIZE THE AI APPLICATIONS
WITH YOUR OWN DATA. SO WITH A
FEW CLICKS YOU CAN GO FROM
GENERIC APPLICATIONS TO ONES
THAT ARE HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND
HIGHLY TAILORED. SO ONE
IMPORTANT TECHNIQUE IS CALLED
FINE TUNING. NOW, WITH FINE
TUNING, YOU POINT THE MODELS TO
EXAMPLES OF DATA IN S3 THAT
YOU'VE LABELED LABELED TO
PROVIDE CONTEXT. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU MIGHT POINT TO PROPOSALS AND
YOU'VE LABELED SOME OF THOSE
PROPOSALS AS STRONG. SO IN THIS
WAY THE MODEL LEARNS FROM YOU,
LEARNS FROM YOUR DATA. WHAT
MATTERS THE MOST TO YOU. AND
THEN BEDROCK MAKES A COPY OF THE
BASE MODELS. IT TRAINS IT, IT
CREATES A PRIVATE FINE TUNED
MODEL SO YOU GET TAILORED
RESPONSES. SO FINE TUNING IS
AVAILABLE IN AMAZON TITAN TEXT
LITE AND EXPRESS, AND TODAY IT'S
ALSO GENERALLY AVAILABLE FOR
COHERE COMMAND LITE AND META
LLAMA 2 AND FINE TUNING IS
COMING TO ANTHROPIC CLAUDE SOON.
SO A SECOND TECHNIQUE FOR
TAILORING TAILORING FOUNDATION
MODELS FOR YOUR BUSINESS IS
CALLED RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED
GENERATION OR RAG ANOTHER ONE OF
THE TERMS YOU SEE OUT THERE A
LOT. SO RAG ALLOWS YOU TO
CUSTOMIZE A MODEL'S RESPONSES
WHEN YOU WANT THE MODEL TO
CONSIDER NEW KNOWLEDGE OR UP TO
DATE INFORMATION. SO BEDROCK
DOES THIS FOR YOU BY CALLING AND
BRINGING BACK YOUR OWN DATA,
YOUR DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES,
INCLUDING DOCUMENT REPOSITORIES,
DATABASES AND OTHER APIS AND
MORE SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MODEL
MIGHT USE RAG TO RETRIEVE SEARCH
RESULTS FROM OUR AMAZON
OPENSEARCH SERVICE OR DOCUMENTS
FROM S3. AND IN SEPTEMBER, WE
INTRODUCED A RAG CAPABILITY
CALLED KNOWLEDGE BASES THAT
CONNECTS FM TO YOUR PROPRIETARY
DATA SOURCES TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR
PROMPTS WITH MORE INFORMATION
AND TODAY KNOWLEDGE BASES IS
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NOW, A
THIRD WAY THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE
MODELS INSIDE OF BEDROCK IS A
TECHNIQUE CALLED CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING. SO CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT
USES LARGE AMOUNTS OF UNLABELED
DATA BEFORE YOU FINE TUNE IT.
YOU DID THE LABELED DATA HERE IS
UNLABELED DATA LIKE THE RAW TEXT
OF INTERNAL REPORTS, FINANCIAL
PLANS OR RESEARCH RESULTS THAT
YOU HAVE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE
USED TO IMPROVE THE MODELS,
KNOWLEDGE AND ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES USING THINGS IN
YOUR OWN SPECIFIC DOMAIN. SO
CONTINUED PRE-TRAINING IS OF
COURSE AVAILABLE IN BEDROCK
TODAY. NOW ALL OF THESE
TECHNIQUES, THEY'RE ALL POWERFUL
TOOLS IN MAKING GENERATIVE AI
TARGETED, MAKING IT TRULY USEFUL
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND BEDROCK
MAKES IT REALLY EASY TO COMBINE
THESE TECHNIQUES TOGETHER. SO A
GREAT EXAMPLE OF A CUSTOMER
USING BEDROCK TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR
GENERATIVE AI AI APPLICATIONS IS
DELTA AIRLINES. SO DELTA IS
ACTUALLY MODERNIZING ITS
CUSTOMER SERVICE CAPABILITY WITH
GENERATIVE AI AI BUILT ON AMAZON
BEDROCK. THE NEW TOOL IS GOING
TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS IN A MORE RELEVANT AND
CONVERSATIONAL STYLE BY
ACCESSING DELTA'S TRAVEL
POLICIES, REAL TIME FLIGHT
SCHEDULES, CUSTOMER REBOOKING
OPTIONS AND AIRPORT CONDITIONS.
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD
RESPOND TO SIMPLE QUESTIONS LIKE
HOW MANY BAGS CAN I CHECK ON A
DELTA FLIGHT? AND IT CAN ALSO DO
MORE COMPLEX QUESTIONS LIKE CAN
I CARRY MY CAT WITH ME IN THE
CABIN TO JAMAICA? OF COURSE.
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH YOUR CAT?
DELTA'S BEEN
TESTING WITH DIFFERENT
FOUNDATION MODELS IN BEDROCK,
INCLUDING ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 2.0
CLAUDE INSTANT AND A FINE TUNED
AMAZON TITAN TEXT EXPRESS MODEL.
AND THIS WAY THEY CAN USE THE
RIGHT MODEL TO ANSWER DIFFERENT
CUSTOMER QUESTIONS IN. IT'S A
REALLY POWERFUL HOW THEY CAN
COMBINE THE MOST RELEVANT
INFORMATION NEEDED TO ANSWER ANY
SPECIFIC QUESTION. NOW, WITH THE
NEW CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOL
DELTA AIRLINES IS AIMING TO
PROVIDE A DELIGHTFUL AND
CONVERSATIONAL SELF-SERVICE
EXPERIENCE AND IT'S GOING TO
IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SO
EVERYONE WANTS MORE RELEVANT
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS,
RIGHT? AND BEDROCK IS MAKING IT
A LOT EASIER TO CUSTOMIZE THOSE
APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR OWN DATA.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU
WANT FMS TO DO MORE THAN JUST
PROVIDE USEFUL AND TARGETED
INFORMATION AND ULTIMATELY WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT IS TO USE
FMS TO TAKE ACTION TO ACTUALLY
GET THINGS DONE AND WE WANTED
YOU TO BE ABLE TO USE BEDROCK TO
COMPLETE ACTIONS LIKE BOOKING
TRAVEL, FILING INSURANCE CLAIMS,
DEPLOYING SOFTWARE, MAYBE
ORDERING REPLACEMENT PARTS. AND
THIS USUALLY REQUIRES
ORCHESTRATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE
SYSTEMS THAT OPERATE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S WHY A
FEW MONTHS AGO, WE INTRODUCED
AGENTS FOR BEDROCK. AND TODAY
I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS
POWERFUL FEATURE IS TODAY.
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. NOW WITH
AGENTS GENAI APPLICATIONS CAN
EXECUTE MULTI-STEP TASKS ACROSS
COMPANY SYSTEMS AND DATA SOURCES
FROM ANSWERING CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS ABOUT PRODUCT
AVAILABLE IOT TO TAKING A SALES
ORDER AND MORE AND BUILDING WITH
AGENTS IS REALLY EASY. FIRST,
YOU USE BEDROCK SETUP WIZARD TO
SELECT THE APPROPRIATE MODEL.
THEN YOU GIVE THE MODEL BASIC
INSTRUCTIONS TO HELP THE MODEL
UNDERSTAND HOW TO RESPOND. LIKE
YOU ARE A FRIENDLY CUSTOMER
SERVICE AGENT WHO HELPS
CUSTOMERS RETURN ITEMS. NEXT,
YOU SPECIFY THE LAMBDA FUNCTIONS
THAT EXECUTE THE API CALLS TO
RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION THAT'S
RELEVANT TO THE TASK. FOR
EXAMPLE, RETURN POLICIES OR
INVENTORY LEVELS. AND FINALLY,
YOU SELECT THE DATA SOURCES.
THEN YOU JUST SELECT, CREATE
AGENT AND BEDROCK, CONFIGURES
YOUR AGENT AND IT IS NOW READY
TO RUN WHEN THE AGENT RECEIVES A
REQUEST, IT USES ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES TO ANALYZE AND TO
PLAN THE TASK. AND THE MODEL
WORKS OUT THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS.
THE INFORMATION NEEDED, THE APIS
TO CALL AND WHEN TO CALL THEM.
THEN IT EXECUTE BETZ THE PLAN,
TAKING ALL THE STEPS THAT IT
NEEDS TO GATHER THE INFORMATION
AND THEN COMPLETE THE TASK. ALL
IN THE BACKGROUND. NO NEED TO
ENGINEER PROMPT, NO NEED TO
TRAIN THE FMS. NO NEED TO
MANUALLY CONNECT SYSTEMS WITH
AGENTS. GENERATIVE AI IS
BECOMING AN INTEGRAL PART OF
YOUR BUSINESS. MAKING IT EASY TO
TAKE ACTIONS AND GET TASKS DONE.
NO HEAVY LIFTING REQUIRED SO
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW BEDROCK
IS MAKING IT EASY TO CHOOSE
AMONGST LEADING MODELS AND ALSO
HOW IT GIVES YOU SO MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA AND HOW IT CAN
HELP COMBINE THE POWER OF MODELS
INTO YOUR ORGANIZATION'S
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA'S AND YOUR
API TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION. BUT
YOU WON'T ACTUALLY USE ANY OF
THIS IN A SERIOUS WAY IF IT
ISN'T SECURE AND PRIVATE.
I MEAN, YOU DEMAND THE
SAME ROCK SOLID RELIABILITY. THE
SAME SECURITY FOR GENERATIVE AI
THAT YOU DO FOR ANY WORKLOAD,
AND YOU REALLY NEED THIS TO HAVE
NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS
THAN EVERYTHING YOU EXPECT FROM
AN AWS SERVICE. IT'S JUST LIKE
S3. EC2. RDS. BEDROCK HAS GOT TO
HAVE ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
FEATURES TO MAKE YOUR DATA SAFE
AND PRIVATE, AND THAT'S WHAT IT
HAS. BEDROCK CUSTOMERS CAN TRUST
THAT THEIR DATA REMAINS
PROTECTED. NO CUSTOMER DATA IS
GOING TO BE USED TO TRAIN OR
IMPROVE THE ORIGINAL BASE
MODELS. WHEN YOU TUNE A MODEL,
WE MAKE A PRIVATE COPY OF THAT
MODEL. WE PUT IT IN A SECURE
CONTAINER AND IT GOES NOWHERE.
YOUR DATA IS NEVER EXPOSED TO
THE PUBLIC INTERNET, NEVER
LEAVES THE AWS NETWORK. IT'S
SECURELY TRANSFERRED THROUGH
YOUR VPC. IT'S ENCRYPTED IN
TRANSIT AND AT REST AND BEDROCK
ENFORCES THE SAME AWS ACCESS
CONTROLS YOU HAVE WITH ANY OF
OUR OTHER SERVICES AS BEDROCK
ALSO SUPPORTS A VARIETY OF
REGULATORY STANDARDS. IT'S HIPAA
ELIGIBLE. IT CAN BE USED IN
COMPLIANCE WITH GDPR. WE'VE
ADDED A BUNCH OF OTHER SECURITY
AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITIES,
INCLUDING INTEGRATIONS WITH
CLOUDWATCH TO TRACK USAGE AND
METRICS. CLOUDTRAIL TO MONITOR
API ACTIVITY AND TROUBLESHOOT
ACTIVITY. AND TODAY BEDROCK IS
SOC COMPLIANT. NOW THIS HELPS A
CUSTOMER ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS
CAN HAVE STRONG CONTROLS AND
POLICIES IN PLACE AND HELPS IT
BE USED IN EVERY BUSINESS. NOW,
BEYOND SECURITY, WE NEED
GENERATIVE AI TO BE DEPLOYED IN
A SAFE, TRUSTWORTHY AND RESPONSE
ABLE FASHION. LIKE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND
THAT'S OUR NORTH STAR FOR THE
CAPABILITIES THAT MAKE GENAI
SUCH A PROMISING TOOL FOR
INNOVATION. ALSO, DO INCREASE
THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE. WE'VE
GOT TO FIND WAYS TO UNLOCK
GENERATIVE AI AI'S FULL
POTENTIAL WHILE MITIGATING THE
RISKS. NOW, DEALING WITH THIS
CHALLENGE IS GOING TO REQUIRE
UNPRECEDENTED COLLABORATION AND
A TRULY MULTI-STAKEHOLDER EFFORT
ACROSS TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES,
POLICY MAKERS, COMMUNITY GROUPS,
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES AND
ACADEMICS. WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATING IN A LOT OF THE
GROUPS THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER
TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES EARLIER
THIS YEAR, I JOINED PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS
LIKE DARIO AS HE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'VE MADE A SERIES OF VOLUNTARY
COMMITMENTS TO PROMOTING THE
SAFE, THE SECURE AND THE
TRANSPARENT DEVELOPMENT OF AI
TECHNOLOGY. AND JUST THIS MONTH,
I JOINED A UK PRIME MINISTER
SUNAK, FOR HIS AI SAFETY SUMMIT
TO DISCUSS NEW APPROACHES,
INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF THEIR
NEW AI SAFETY INSTITUTE. NOW AN
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF
RESPONSIBLE AI IS PROMOTING THE
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOUR
CONSUMERS AND THE APPLICATIONS
THAT ARE SAFE THAT AVOID HARMFUL
OUTPUTS AND THAT STAY WITHIN
YOUR COMPANY'S GUIDELINES. AND
THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO
ACTUALLY PLACE LIMITS ON WHAT
INFORMATION THE MODELS CAN AND
CAN'T RETURN. AND WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD HERE, AND TODAY
WE'RE ANNOUNCING GUARDRAILS FOR
AMAZON BEDROCK. NOW THIS IS A
NEW CAPABILITY THAT HELPS YOU
EASILY SAFEGUARD YOUR GENERATIVE
AI APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR
RESPONSIBLE AI POLICIES TO
CREATE A GUARDRAIL. BEDROCK
PROVIDES CONFIGURATION WIZARD SO
YOU CAN ENTER A NATURAL LANGUAGE
DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPICS THAT
YOU WANT. THE MODEL TO AVOID.
GUARDRAILS CAN BE USED WITH ANY
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS
ACCESSIBLE VIA BEDROCK,
INCLUDING THE CUSTOM MODELS THAT
YOU CREATE THROUGH YOUR OWN FINE
TUNING AND YOU CAN ALSO USE
GUARDRAILS WITH AGENTS. SO NOW
YOU CAN HAVE A CONSISTENT LEVEL
OF PROTECTION ACROSS ALL OF YOUR
GENAI GENAI DEVELOPMENT
ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, A BANK
COULD CONFIGURE AN ONLINE
ASSISTANT TO REFRAIN FROM
PROVIDING INVESTMENT ADVICE OR
TO PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT
. AN E COMMERCE SITE COULD
ENSURE THAT ITS ONLINE ASSISTANT
DOESN'T USE HATE SPEECH OR
INSULTS OR A UTILITY COMPANY
COULD REMOVE PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR PII
FROM A CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL
SUMMARY. SO WE'RE APPROACHING
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF GENERATIVE
AI IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT
WAY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT
IT TAKES TO REINVENT. HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO BUILD WITH THIS
TECHNOLOGY? WE JUST, AS YOU'VE
USED AWS TO REINVENT HOW YOU'VE
BUILT AND INNOVATE IT FOR YEARS
AND ULTIMATELY TO TRANSFORM HOW
YOUR ORGANIZATION OPERATES,
WHETHER YOU'RE MIGRATING
ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS,
BUILDING THE NEXT HOT STARTUP OR
OR DEPLOYING YOUR GENERATIVE AI
STRATEGY. OUR APPROACH REMAINS
THE SAME. UM, CUSTOMER
OBSESSION, INNOVATION AND A LONG
TERM VIEW OF WHAT JOINT SUCCESS
REALLY MEANS. TO TELL US MORE
ABOUT HOW HER COMPANY IS BUILT
ON AWS AND IS NOW REINVENTING
WITH GENERATIVE AI, PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE LIDIA
FONSECA, THE CHIEF DIGITAL AND
TECHNICAL OFFICER OF PFIZER.
THANK EVERYBODY. I'D LIKE TO
START BY ASKING HOW MANY
PATIENTS DO YOU THINK PFIZER
TREATED LAST YEAR? YOU MAY BE
THINKING IN THE MILLIONS, BUT IN
FACT WE TREATED 1.3 BILLION
PATIENTS WITH OUR MEDICINES AND
VACCINES. THAT'S ONE OUT OF SIX
HUMANS ON THE PLANET. A TRULY
HUMBLING, ACCOMPLISHED AGENT.
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE
RECOGNIZED AS AN INNOVATIVE AND
ETHICAL COMPANY LISTED IN
FORTUNE'S WORLD'S MOST ADMIRED
COMPANIES. FORBES WORLD'S BEST
EMPLOYERS, AND TIME MAGAZINE'S
WORLD'S BEST COMPANIES, PFIZER
IS EXPERIENCING AN EXCITING
PERIOD OF INNOVATION AND GROWTH
WITH THE LAUNCH OF 90 MEDICINES
AND VACCINES IN 18 MONTHS. THIS
HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BY US OR ANY
OTHER PHARMA COMPANY. IT IS AN
INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS GOAL AND WE
ARE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 13
ALREADY LAUNCHED DIGITAL DATA
AND AI ARE CRITICAL TO OUR
SUCCESS. AS AND WHAT
DIFFERENTIATES PFIZER IS THAT WE
APPLY THIS ACROSS ALL BUSINESS
UNITS. OUR 36 PLANTS AND THE 149
MARKETS THAT WE SERVE QUICKLY
AND AT SCALE TO BRING MEDICINES
TO PATIENTS FASTER. OUR SUCCESS
TODAY RESTS ON THE GROUNDWORK WE
LAID FOR TECHNOLOGY AND AI TO
FLOURISH. CENTRAL IZING OUR
DATA, CREATE STANDARD PLATFORMS,
CULTIVATING STRONG TALENT AND
BUILDING A SECURE FOUNDATION IN
ALL TO INNOVATE FOR MAXIMUM
IMPACT. WE COULD NOT HAVE
ACHIEVED THIS TREMENDOUS REACH
WITHOUT OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
WITH AWS. SO LET ME SHARE A BIT
ABOUT OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER. IN
2019 PFIZER AND AWS CREATED A
PIONEERING SCIENCE DATA CLOUD
THAT AGGREGATES MULTIMODAL DATA
FROM HUNDREDS OF LABORATORY
INSTRUMENTS, EMPOWERING OUR
SCIENTISTS TO SEARCH ALL
HISTORICAL MOLECULE AND COMPOUND
DATA IN REAL TIME COMPARED TO
WEEKS OR MONTHS IN OUR PRIOR
FRAGMENTED ENVIRONMENT AND THE
SCIENTIFIC DATA CLOUD
ACCELERATES ANALYSIS AND
COMPUTATION OF RESEARCH AND WITH
AI ALGORITHMS THAT HELP US
IDENTIFY AND DESIGN THE MOST
PROMISING NEW MOLECULES IS
BUILDING ON THAT SUCCESS IN
2021. PFIZER EMBARKED ON ONE OF
OUR BOLDEST INITIATIVE IS GOING
FROM 10% OF OUR CORE IN THE TO
CLOUD 80% MOVING IN 12,000
APPLICATIONS AND 8000 SERVERS IN
42 WEEKS. ONE OF THE FASTEST
MIGRATIONS FOR A COMPANY OUR
SIZE. THIS MOVE TO AWS SAVED US
$47 MILLION A YEAR AND HELPED US
EXIT THREE DATA CENTERS,
REDUCING 4700 TONS OF CO2
EMISSIONS OR THE EQUIVALENT
ENERGY USE BY 1000 HOMES IN A
YEAR. BUT VERY IMPORTANT ALI. IT
ENABLED US TO INNOVATE WITH
SPEED AND AT SCALE. FOR EXAMPLE,
WE REDUCED TIME TO SET UP
COMPUTING CAPACITY FROM MONTHS
TO HOURS, SPEEDING UP DATA
GENERATION FOR DRUG SUBMISSIONS
BY. 75. AND WHEN COVID HIT, AWS
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO OFFER
THEIR HELP, SCALING US INTO THE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL
CORES IN THE CLOUD AND
ACCELERATING MANUFACTURING AND
CLINICAL TRIALS. WHEN WE RAN
COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE
ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO
MANUFACTURE OUR COVID VACCINE,
AWS JUMPED IN WITH ADDITIONAL
CPUS FOR US TO MOVE FAST. AND
WHEN WE NEEDED TO SUBMIT DATA TO
THE FDA IN UNDER A DAY,
INCREASED OUR CAPACITY IN
ENABLING PFIZER TO MOVE AT THE
SPEED OF SCIENCE. IN FACT, IT
TOOK JUST 269 DAYS FROM WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED OUR PLANS TO DEVELOP A
COVID 19 VACCINE WITH BIONTECH
TO THE DAY THAT WE RECEIVED THE
FDA'S EMERGENCY USE
AUTHORIZATION ACTION. THIS
NORMALLY TAKES 8 TO 10 YEARS.
THANK YOU. WITH THE WORLD
WAITING, WE NEEDED TO
MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE THE
VACCINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
WE HELD FIRM TO OUR MANTRA
SCIENCE WILL WIN. WELL WHILE
SCIENCE DID WIN AND DIGITAL
HELPED US DO IT FASTER, PFIZER
OUR INDUSTRY LEADING DIGITAL
OPERATIONS CENTER ALLOWED US
COLLEAGUES TO SEE PRODUCTION
STATUS ACROSS PLANTS AND RESOLVE
ISSUES IN REAL TIME, YIELDING A
20% THROUGHPUT INCREASE. OUR
MRNA PREDICTION ALGORITHM
YIELDED 20,000 MORE VACCINE
DOSES PER BATCH. IMAGINE THE
LIVES IMPACT IT. TO GIVE YOU AN
IDEA OF THE SCALE, PRIOR TO
COVID, PFIZER PRODUCED 220
MILLION VACCINE DOSES IN TOTAL
AND SCALED TO 4 BILLION OF
COMMUNITY IN 2022. THIS IS NOW
AT THE HEART OF HOW OUR PLANTS
OPERATE, AND WE'RE APPLYING
THESE INNOVATIONS TO THE TO OUR
OTHER MEDICINES AND VACCINES.
MORE RECENTLY, AWS HELPED US
APPLY AI TO GENERATE ALERTS
ABOUT POTENTIAL SUPPLY CHAIN
DISRUPTIONS, PROMPTING US TO
REROUTE SHIPMENTS TO CONTINUE
DELIVERING MEDICINES TO CLINICAL
TRIAL SITES AHEAD OF HURRICANE
IAN'S LANDFALL. DIGITAL AI MADE
IT POSSIBLE FOR PFIZER TO BRING
MEDICINES TO PATIENTS AROUND THE
GLOBE FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE.
NOW LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S NEXT.
AS YOU HEARD, PFIZER HAS BEEN
HARNESSING AI TO DRIVE
INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY ON A
GLOBAL SCALE. AND MORE RECENTLY,
WE ARE LEVERAGING GENERATIVE AI,
WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO DELIVER
ANNUAL COST SAVINGS OF 750
MILLION TO $1 BILLION IN THE
NEAR TERM. SOME REAL TANGIBLE
VALUE TO USING AWS CLOUD
SERVICES. PFIZER QUICKLY
DEPLOYED FOX OUR INTERNAL
GENERATIVE AI PLATFORM ALLOWING
COLLEAGUES TO ACCESS LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS AVAILABLE IN
AMAZON BEDROCK AND SAGEMAKER AWS
BREADTH OF SERVICES AND THE
VARIETY OF LMS IN BEDROCK MEANS
WE CAN SELECT THE BEST TOOLS FOR
USE CASES IN R&D, MANUFACTURE,
MARKETING AND MORE ENABLING
PFIZER AND AWS TO PROTOTYPE 17
DIFFERENT USE CASES IN A MATTER
OF WEEKS. I IN GENERATIVE AI
WILL HELP US IDENTIFY NEW
ONCOLOGY TARGETS, A PROCESS THAT
IS LARGELY MANUAL TODAY WITH AI,
WE CAN SEARCH AND COLLATE
RELEVANT DATA AND SCIENTIFIC
CONTENT FROM MANY MORE SOURCES
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME AND
ALGORITHMS GENERATE AND VALIDATE
POTENTIAL TARGETS TO IMPROVE OUR
SCIENTIFIC SUCCESS WITH BEDROCK,
WE CAN SCAN THE MARKETPLACE FOR
COMPANIES AND ASSETS AUTOMATING
THE CREATION OF COMPANY PROFILES
TO PRIORITIZE POTENTIAL
ACQUISITION ROLES IN
MANUFACTURING. BEDROCK TAKES THE
OPTIMAL PROCESS PARAMETERS TO
IDENTIFY WHAT WE CALL THE GOLDEN
BATCH AND USES GENERATIVE AI TO
DETECT ANOMALIES AND RECOMMEND
ACTIONS TO OUR OPERATORS IN REAL
TIME. AIMING TO IMPROVE CYCLE
TIME BY 25% AWS IS AGILE CULTURE
ALIGNS WELL WITH PFIZER'S
LIGHTSAIL LEAD WAY OF WORKING.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING ON
OUR LEARNINGS TO UNDERSTAND AND
NOT JUST HOW AI CAN TRANSFORM
OUR DAILY WORK, BUT HOW IT MAY
HELP US DISRUPT THE INDUSTRY.
ORI TO CLOSE, WE'RE EXCITED TO
ACCELERATE OUR BATTLE AGAINST
CANCER. WITH PFIZER'S PROPOSED
ACQUISITION OF CDN, A BIOTECH
FOCUSED ON CANCER THERAPY. AS WE
PLAN TO BRING JENS LEADING EDGE
ANTIBODY DRUG CONJUGATE
TECHNOLOGY TO MORE PATIENTS WITH
CANCER, FASTER. YOU SEE, WE HOPE
TO ACHIEVE WITH CANCER WHAT WE
WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH COVID.
OUR WORK WITH THE AWS WILL HELP
US CONTINUE THIS GREAT MOMENTUM
FUELING OUR AMBITION TO CHANGE A
BILLION LIVES EVERY YEAR, NOT
JUST IN A PANDEMIC YEAR. THANK
YOU, AWS FOR HELPING PFIZER
BRING BREAKTHROUGHS TO PATIENTS
FASTER BECAUSE IN THE BATTLE
AGAINST DISEASE, TIME IS LIFE.
THANK YOU ALL. ONE OUT OF EVERY
SIX PEOPLE ON THE PLANET ARE
IMPACTED BY PFIZER. I MEAN, THAT
IS JUST SO IMPRESSIVE. SO
IMPRESSIVE. LYDIA MEANS SO MUCH
TO US, HONESTLY, THAT YOU'VE
TRUSTED AWS TO. TO HELP DELIVER
ALL THESE CAPABILITIES. THESE
BREAKTHROUGHS THAT ARE CHANGING
PEOPLE'S LIVES. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. AND THANK YOU, ADAM AWS
HAS JUST BEEN AN AMAZING
PARTNER. THANK YOU. WE LOOK
FORWARD TO MORE. THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. SO
ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE
ARE USING AWS FOR AGILITY FOR
SPEED AND FOR THE SCALE THAT
THEY NEED TO DRIVE THEIR
FUTURES. BUT THIS REQUIRES
EMPLOYEES WITH TOP NOTCH CLOUD
SKILLS. AND WE KNOW THAT NOT
ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE THAT CLOUD
EXPERTISE AND THAT THERE'S A
LARGE SKILL GAP THAT'S GOT TO BE
CLOSED. SO GENERATIVE AI IS OF
COURSE, THE NEXT INCREDIBLY
EXCITING NEW OPPORTUNITY. BUT
IT'S ONLY GOING TO ADD TO THAT
GAP. AND SO WE'RE INVESTING TO
HELP PROVIDE THE CLOUD SCALE
SKILLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
NEEDED ACROSS THE WORLD FOR
YEARS TO COME. AWS IS COMMITTED
TO TRAINING 29 MILLION PEOPLE
FOR FREE WITH CLOUD COMPUTING
SKILLS BY THE YEAR 2025. AND
WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 21
MILLION ALREADY TRAINED. AND WE
JUST LAUNCHED WE JUST RECENTLY
LAUNCHED THE AWS CLOUD
INSTITUTE, WHICH IS PROVIDING
DEEP CLOUD EXPERTISE TO HELP
STUDENTS LAUNCH AN ENTIRE CLOUD
CAREER. AND WE'VE ALSO LAUNCHED
100 DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING
AND AI COURSES AND RESOURCES TO
SUPPORT INNOVATION AND JUST OVER
A WEEK AGO, WE ANNOUNCED AI
READY, WHICH IS OUR NEW
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE FREE AI
SKILLS TO ANOTHER 2 MILLION
PEOPLE BY 2025 AND TO HELP
STUDENTS AROUND THE WORLD WITH
TO LEARN THE FOUNDATION SKILLS
AND TO PREPARE FOR A CAREER IN
TECH. WE ACTUALLY CREATED AN AI
AND MACHINE LEARNING SCHOLARSHIP
FUND. LET'S MEET SOME OF THE
RECIPIENT. THIS. MY NAME IS
VANIA GAREWAL. MY NAME IS JOSE
TAPIA. MY NAME IS OLYMPIA
OTIENO. WITHOUT THE AI/ML
SCHOLARSHIP, I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP MY OWN
QUESTIONS. KNOW WHAT TOOLS ARE
AVAILABLE TO SOLVE THEM. THE
NANODEGREE IS DEFINITELY
UNLOCKED. MY INTEREST IN AI
CONSTANTLY TRY TO GO OUT THERE
AND TALK TO GIRLS WHO ARE
CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN
LIFE IN KENYA DUE TO CROP
DISEASE WIZ THE RATES AT WHICH
THE YIELDS HAVE BEEN DROPPING IS
DEVASTATING. SO MY COLLEAGUES
AND I HAVE MADE A MOBILE
APPLICATION WITH AI FARMERS
PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE CROP
DISEASES. THE FACT THAT I WAS
ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM,
I NOW KNOW THAT I AM CAPABLE OF
DOING WELL IN THIS FIELD. I
MEAN, THIS IS WHY WE DO THIS
STUFF, RIGHT? WHAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE
JOSE AND OLYMPIA HERE WITH US
TODAY. SO COME ON, LET'S GIVE
THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THERE
WE GO. TO BOTH OF YOU. I'M SO
PROUD. I'M REALLY PROUD OF WHAT
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE. AND I JUST
REALLY HOPE THAT REINVENT THIS
WEEK IS JUST A GREAT, GREAT
EXPERIENCE FOR YOU. THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR LETTING US SHARE YOUR
STORIES AND FOR EVERYONE
WATCHING, WE WANT TO EMPOWER ALL
OF YOU TO BUILD AND TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF IMPACT. AND WE SEE A
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THAT BY
INFUSING GENERATIVE AI INTO ALL
OF THE SYSTEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE
USING INTO THEIR DAILY LIVES. WE
BELIEVE THAT GENERATIVE AI
SHOULD HELP EVERYONE AT WORK
SEAMLESSLY WITH HELPFUL,
RELEVANT ASSISTANCE. WHETHER OR
NOT, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST THING
ABOUT FOUNDATION MODELS IS RAG
OR ANY OF THE REST. AND THAT
BRINGS US TO THE TOP OF THE
STACK, THE APPLICATIONS THAT YOU
USE THAT ARE POWERED BY
GENERATIVE AI, LEVERAGING
FOUNDATION MODELS. WE BELIEVE
THAT GENERATIVE AI, OF COURSE,
HAS THE POTENTIAL OVER TIME TO
TRANSFORM VIRTUALLY EVERY
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THAT WE
KNOW. IT CAN POUR THROUGH THE
NOOKS AND CRANNIES OF A SYSTEM
AND ACTUALLY HELP YOU FIND DATA
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
EXISTED. AND THEN HELP YOU PUT
IT TO OPTIMAL USE. IT CAN
GENERATE INSIGHTS THAT CAN SAVE
HOURS OF MANUAL WORK AND IT CAN
TAKE PROJECTS THAT WERE SLOGS
AND MAKE THEM A SNAP. NOW, ONE
IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS HOW
GENERATIVE AI CAN MAKE THE TASK
OF WRITING CODE RADICALLY
FASTER. AND SO LAST YEAR WE
RELEASED AMAZON CODEWHISPERER,
WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD GENERATIVE
AI, WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD
APPLICATIONS, I SHOULD SAY,
FASTER AND MORE SECURELY BY
GENERATING CODE SUGGESTIONS IN
NEAR REAL TIME. NOW WITH
CODEWHISPERER DEVELOPERS USE A
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPT AND THEN
RECEIVE ACCURATE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN EVERY POPULAR IDE
. AND FOR 15 OF THE MOST POPULAR
PROGRAMING LANGUAGES, A
CODEWHISPERER GIVES DEVELOPERS A
POWERFUL BOOST FOR GENERAL CODE
EXAMPLES. AND OF COURSE WE MADE
SURE THAT IT'S GREAT FOR
PROVIDING SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS
FOR CODE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
WARNER MUSIC GROUP, THE
BUNDESLIGA AND THE CIGNA GROUP
HAVE EMBRACED CODEWHISPERER TO
ACCELERATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT
CAPABILITIES, AND TATA
CONSULTANCY SERVICES, AWS,
ACCENTURE AND HCLTECH ARE MAKING
CODEWHISPERER AVAILABLE TO TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES EACH.
NOW COHEN IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN
THE ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR
INDUSTRY. THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT CODEWHISPERER IS A GAME
CHANGER FOR THEM AND WE WANT AS
MANY DEVELOPERS AS POSSIBLE TO
REAP THE BENEFITS. AND SO WHAT
WE'VE DONE IS TO MAKE CODE
WHISPERER, TO MAKE THE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN IT FREE, FREE FOR
INDIVIDUAL USE. NOW THE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CODE
WHISPERS ARE GREAT FOR GENERAL
CODING TASKS, BUT GENERAL CODING
SUGGESTIONS CAN ONLY GET YOUR
DEVELOPERS SO FAR. IMAGINE
YOU'VE JUST HIRED A NEW
DEVELOPER FOR EVEN IF THEY ARE
WORLD CLASS, THEY ARE NOT GOING
TO DO THEIR BEST WORK UNTIL THEY
UNDERSTAND YOUR CODE BASE AND
YOUR INTERNAL BEST PRACTICES. AN
AI POWERED CODING TOOLS ARE
SIMILAR. YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT
TOOL, BUT FOR THE KIND OF SPEED
AND RELEVANCY THAT MAKES THE
MOST DIFFERENCE, YOUR SOLUTION
HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF
YOUR CODE AND THE BEST PLACE TO
FIND THAT CONTEXT IS INSIDE OF
YOUR INTERNAL APIS, YOUR
LIBRARIES AND YOUR PACKAGES.
THAT'S WHY A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AGO WE PREVIEWED A CAPABILITY
THAT ALLOWS CODEWHISPERER TO
SECURELY LEARN FROM YOUR
INTERNAL CODE BASE TO PROVIDE
MUCH, MUCH MORE PERTINENT,
CUSTOMIZED AND USEFUL CODE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS. CODEWHISPERER IS
AN EXPERT ON YOUR CODE AND CAN
PROVIDE MUCH MORE TAILORED
SUGGESTIONS. CREATING AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR INTERNAL
SDKS, YOUR APIS, YOUR LANGUAGES
AND YOUR CLASSES. AND OF COURSE
ANY CUSTOMIZATIONS ARE ISOLATE
AND WE NEVER USE CUSTOMERS
CONTENT FROM CODEWHISPERER TO
TRAIN ANY OF OUR UNDERLYING
MODELS. NOW TO UNDERSTAND THE
IMPACT OF THIS KIND OF
CUSTOMIZATION, WE WORKED WITH
PERSISTENT A DIGITAL ENGINEERING
PROVIDER. NOW
THEIR STUDIES SHOWED THAT
DEVELOPERS USING CODEWHISPERER
COMPLETED THEIR TASKS AN
ADDITIONAL 28% FASTER WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS THAN WITHOUT 28.
AND AWS IS THE ONLY MAJOR CLOUD
PROVIDER THAT'S CURRENTLY
AUTHORIZING OFFERING A
CUSTOMIZED CAPABILITY THAT
ANYONE CAN SIGN UP FOR AND USE
TODAY. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT CODEWHISPERER ABOUT
CODEWHISPERER CUSTOMIZATIONS AND
HOW IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU
ACCELERATE YOUR WORK AND
INCREASE YOUR IMPACT. BUT WE'RE
JUST GETTING STARTED AND WE SEE
A LOT MORE POTENTIAL USES WITH
GENERATIVE AI. FOR EXAMPLE,
THINK ABOUT GENERATIVE AI CHAT
APPLICATIONS. SO THESE DAYS IT
SEEMS LIKE JUST ABOUT EVERYONE
IS EXPERIMENTING WITH THEM,
RIGHT? AND WHAT THE EARLY
PROVIDERS IN THIS SPACE HAVE
DONE IS REALLY EXCITING AND IT'S
GENUINELY SUPER USEFUL FOR
CONSUMER OWNERS. BUT IN A LOT OF
WAYS, THESE APPLICATIONS DON'T
REALLY WORK AT WORK. THEY'RE
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR
CAPABILITIES ARE GREAT, BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR COMPANY. THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR DATA, YOUR
CUSTOMERS OR YOUR OPERATIONS.
AND THIS LIMITS HOW HOW USEFUL
THEIR SUGGESTIONS CAN BE. THEY
ALSO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHO
YOU ARE AT WORK. THEY DON'T KNOW
YOUR ROLE, YOUR PREFERENCES,
WHAT INFORMATION YOU USE AND
WHAT YOU DO, AND DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO. SO CRITICALLY. OTHER
PROVIDERS WHO HAVE LAUNCHED
TOOLS, THEY'VE LAUNCHED THEM
WITHOUT DATA PRIVACY AND
SECURITY CAPABILITIES. THE
VIRTUE ALI EVERY ENTERPRISE
REQUIRES. AND SO MANY CIOS
ACTUALLY BANNED THE USE OF A LOT
OF THESE MOST POPULAR CHAT
ASSISTANTS INSIDE THEIR
ORGANIZATIONS. AND THIS HAS BEEN
WELL PUBLICIZED AND JUST ASK ANY
CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY
OFFICER OR CSO AND THEY'LL TELL
YOU YOU CAN'T REALLY BOLT ON
SECURITY AFTER THE FACT. AND
EXPECT IT TO WORK AS WELL. IT'S
MUCH, MUCH BETTER TO BUILD
SECURITY INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL
DESIGN OF THE TECHNOLOGY. SO
WHEN WE SET OUT TO BUILD
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS, WE
KNEW WE HAD TO ADDRESS THESE
GAPS, HAD TO BE BUILT IN FROM
THE VERY START. RIGHT? AND
THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M REALLY
PROUD AND EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
AMAZON MQ A NEW TYPE OF
GENERATIVE AI POWERED ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO WORK FOR YOU AT WORK
. Q LETS YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS
QUICKLY WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE
INTERACTIONS, YOU CAN EASILY
CHAT, GENERATE CONTENT, TAKE
ACTIONS, AND IT'S ALL INFORMED
BY AN UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA REPOSITOR WIZ
YOUR OPERATIONS. AND OF COURSE
WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT ROCK SOLID
SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARE. SO Q
UNDERSTANDS AND RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING IDENTITIES, YOUR ROLES
AND YOUR PERMISSIONS. IF A USER
DOES NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO
ACCESS SOMETHING WITHOUT Q, THEY
CANNOT ACCESS IT WITH Q EITHER.
AND WE'VE DESIGNED Q TO MEET
ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS AND
ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS STRINGENT
REQUIREMENTS FROM DAY ONE. AND
WE NEVER WANT BUSINESS CUSTOMERS
CONTENT. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
USE THAT CONTENT FOR. Q TO TRAIN
UNDERLYING MODELS. I REALLY
BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO BE
TRANSFORMATIVE. WE WANT LOTS OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO DO
LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
TO BENEFIT FROM AMAZON. Q NOW,
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. WE WANT Q
TO HELP DEVELOPERS AND BUILDERS
BE MORE EFFICIENT, MORE
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND MORE
PROFICIENT. SO FOR STARTERS,
AMAZON Q IS YOUR EXPERT
ASSISTANT FOR BUILDING ON AWS
NOW TO SUPERCHARGE WORK FOR
DEVELOPERS AND IT PROS? WE'VE
TRAINED AMAZON Q ON 17 YEARS
WORTH OF KNOWLEDGE SO IT CAN
TRANSFORM THE WAY YOU THINK,
OPTIMIZE AND OPERATE
APPLICATIONS AND WORKLOADS ON
AWS AND WE'VE PUT AMAZON. Q
WHERE YOU WORK, SO IT'S READY TO
ASSIST YOU IN THE AWS MANAGEMENT
CONSOLE AND DOCUMENTATION CHAN
IN YOUR IDP VIA CODEWHISPERER
AND IN YOUR TEAM CHAT ROOMS LIKE
SLACK, YOU CAN CHAT WITH AWS
CLOUD TO EXPLORE AWS
CAPABILITIES, LEARN UNFAMILIAR
TECHNOLOGIES, ARCHITECT
SOLUTIONS. ITS AN EXPERT IN AWS
WELL-ARCHITECTED PATTERNS LEARNS
BEST PRACTICES AND SOLUTION
IMPLEMENTATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK AMAZON Q HOW DO I
BUILD A WEB APPLICATION WITH
AWS? WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? IT'S
GOING TO ANSWER WITH A LIST OF
POTENTIAL SERVICES THAT YOU
COULD USE, SUCH AS AMPLIFY,
LAMBDA OR EC2, AND THEN IT'S
GOING TO OFFER REASONS WHY YOU
MIGHT CONSIDER EACH SERVICE.
FROM THERE YOU CAN FURTHER
NARROW DOWN YOUR OPTIONS THROUGH
NATURAL LANGUAGE, LIKE WHICH OF
THESE WOULD BE PREFERRED? IF MY
APP IS ONLY NEEDS TO RUN FOR A
FEW SECONDS AND ONLY HAS VERY
INFREQUENT TRAFFIC LAMBDA AMAZON
Q IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR
REQUIREMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION
AND IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE YOU
WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ONCE YOU'VE
CHOSEN A SERVICE, YOU CAN ASK
AMAZON. Q HOW DO I GET STARTED?
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU STEP
BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR
CONFIGURING THE SOLUTION PLUS
LINKS TO RELEVANT INFORMATION TO
DOCUMENT STATION AND SO ON. AND
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF
HOW AMAZON Q IS GOING TO HELP
YOU WITH YOUR WORK. FOR EXAMPLE,
IF YOU ENCOUNTER AN ERROR WITH
LAMBDA IN THE CONSOLE, YOU JUST
PRESS THE TROUBLESHOOT ROUTE
WITH AMAZON Q BUTTON, AND Q IS
GOING TO RESEARCH THE ERROR, AND
IT'S GOING TO SUGGEST HOW TO FIX
IT. AMAZON. Q CAN ALSO
TROUBLESHOOT YOUR NETWORK
CONNECTIONS AND IT CAN ANALYZE
YOUR END TO END NETWORK
CONFIGURATION AND HELP RESOLVE
OF CONNECTIVITY ISSUES QUICKLY.
THAT IS A HUGE TIME SAVER. NOW
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU HELP US WITH?
HOW ABOUT CHOOSING THE OPTIMAL
EC2 INSTANCE SO YOU CAN JUST
TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR WORKLOAD AND
GET AN ACCURATE, QUICK AND
ECONOMICAL INSTANCE TYPE
RECOMMENDATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
WHICH EC2 INSTANCE TYPES PROVIDE
THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE FOR
VIDEO ENCODING AND TRANSCODING
WORKLOADS SUPPORTING GAMING USE
CASES AND YOU GET YOUR
RECOMMENDATION. IT'S THAT EASY.
THIS IS ALL VERY COOL AND WE
EXPECT THAT AMAZON Q IS GOING TO
SAVE CUSTOMERS SO MUCH TIME IN
ARCHITECTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
AND OPTIMIZING YOUR WORKLOADS.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL THE Q CAN DO
FOR YOU. AMAZON Q IS ALSO GOING
TO BE IN THE IDP FOR DEVELOPERS.
IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE
CODE IN THE IDE OR YOU NEED TO
DIG IN INTO HOW A SPECIFIC
FUNCTION WORKS, AMAZON, Q AND
CODEWHISPERER IS GOING TO HELP
YOU GET UP TO SPEED BY USING ITS
DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF AWS AND ITS
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR CODE BASES
. SO YOU NEED TO ADD TESTS. JUST
ASK Q AND IT'S GOING TO
AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE THE TEST
FOR YOU. AND THIS IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
DEVELOPERS. BUT WE KNEW WE COULD
DO EVEN MORE TO HELP YOU BUILD
EVEN FASTER. FOR EXAMPLE, THINK
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO
BUILDING A NEW FEATURE. YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENTS.
THINK THROUGH DESIGN, WRITE ALL
THE CODE, ADD TESTS, DOCUMENT
THE CODE AND SO ON, AND A FILE
COULD SPAN HUNDREDS TO EVEN
THOUSANDS OF LINES OF CODE. AND
THIS IS A DAUNTING TASK. IF
YOU'RE USING AMAZON
CODEWHISPERER IT'S GOING TO
GENERATE CHUNKS OF NEW CODE FOR
YOU, WHICH IS A REAL TIME SAVER
THAT STILL LEAVES ALL THE REST.
SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR
AMAZON. Q SPECIFICALLY, Q'S
FEATURE DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY,
WHICH IS GOING TO AUTOMATE THE
MULTI STEP DEVELOPMENT TASK OF
ADDING NEW FEATURES TO YOUR
APPLICATION. SO INSTEAD OF ALL
THAT WORK NOW YOU JUST WRITE A
PROMPT AND Q IS GOING TO USE ITS
EXPERTISE ENRICHED WITH AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR PROJECT
CODE, AND IT'S GOING TO DO ALL
THE HEAVY LIFTING FOR YOU. SO
AMAZON Q WILL CREATE THE DRAFT
PLAN, WHICH YOU CAN THEN
COLLABORATE AND ITERATIVELY
IMPROVE USING NATURAL LANGUAGE
CHAT UNTIL IT'S POLISHED AND
READY TO GO. AND THEN Q REALLY
KICKS INTO GEAR. IT'S GOING TO
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN ACROSS YOUR
FILES IN YOUR APPLICATION. AN
AND YOU REMAIN IN CONTROL USING
YOUR EXPERTISE TO REVIEW CHANGES
AND ENSURE THE VERY BEST
QUALITY. SO THIS IS HOURS OF
WORK THAT Q CAN DO FOR YOU WITH
JUST ONE GOOD PROMPT. AND THIS
FEATURE IS AVAILABLE TODAY IN
AMAZON CODE CATALYST AND WILL
SOON BE FULLY AVAILABLE IN THE
IDE. YOU WILL NOT CURRENTLY FIND
AN AI ASSISTANT FROM ANOTHER
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER THAT CAN DO
THIS FOR YOU TODAY. BUT WE'RE
NOT DONE YET. LET'S KEEP GOING.
WE KNOW THAT DEVELOPERS SPEND A
LOT OF TIME SLOGGING THROUGH THE
MUCK THAT COMES WITH MAINTENANCE
AND UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE AND
UPGRADES. BIG DEAL, RIGHT? SO
TAKE TAKE LANGUAGE VERSION
UPGRADES, FOR EXAMPLE. HOW MANY
OF YOU ARE USING OLDER VERSIONS
OF JAVA? BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO
TAKE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS TO
UPGRADE HANDS? OH YEAH. A LOT OF
THEM. SO MIGRATIONS ARE
INEVITABLY COME WITH A LOT OF
NUANCE AND EDGE CASES. AND SO
YOU END UP SPENDING A TON OF
TIME WRITING AND REWRITING THE
CODE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND
TRYING TO GET IT COMPILE TO
COMPILE AND WORK. AND SOMETIMES
THESE PROGRAMS TAKE SO LONG THAT
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE IN A
MIGRATION INFINITY LOOP. JUST AS
ONE ENDS, THE NEXT BEGINS. AND
IT'S NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE
TEMPTATION TO JUST MAINTAIN
STATUS QUO. BUT DOING THAT MEANS
THAT YOU MISS OUT ON PERFORMANCE
IMPROVEMENTS AND IT MEANS MUCH
WORSE THAT IT CAN ALSO OPEN YOU
UP TO POTENTIAL SECURITY
VULNERABILITIES. AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT INTO AMAZON. Q CODE
TRANSFORMATION, WHICH HELPS YOU
WITH UPGRADES TO TRANSFORM CODE
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME THAT
IT TAKES TODAY. ALL THE
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO ALL A
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO IS ASK YOU
TO PERFORM THE CODE
TRANSFORMATION AND IT HANDLES
THE REST FROM IDENTIFYING AND
UPGRADING AND MANDATORY CODE
PACKAGE DEPOSITORIES AND
FRAMEWORKS TO REPLACING
DEPRECATED CODE AND
INCORPORATING SECURITY BEST
PRACTICES. CUZ EVEN GOING TO RUN
TESTS ON THE UPGRADED
APPLICATION VERSION. SO WE'VE
BEEN USING THIS, THIS
APPLICATION, THIS THIS
CAPABILITY INTERNALLY AND THE
RESULTS ARE STUNNING. SO WITH
AMAZON Q TRANSFORMATION IN A
VERY SMALL TEAM OF AMAZON
DEVELOPERS SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADED
1000 APPLICATIONS FROM JAVA
EIGHT TO JAVA 17 IN JUST TWO
DAYS. NOW I'M GOING TO SAY THAT
AGAIN, 1000 APPLICATION UPGRADES
IN TWO DAYS. THAT'S HOW LONG A
SINGLE APPLICATION UPGRADE USED
TO TAKE. I MEAN, THIS IS MONTHS,
MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS OF
DEVELOPER TIME SAVED A LOT OF
VERY HAPPY PEOPLE AT AMAZON OVER
THIS. I PROMISE YOU. SO TODAY,
AMAZON. Q CAN WORK ITS MAGIC ON
JAVA UPGRADES, BUT SOON YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT TO
HELP MIGRATE YOUR NETWORK LOADS
FROM WINDOWS TO LINUX. AND THERE
ARE A LOT OF APPLICATIONS OUT
THERE STUCK ON WINDOWS BECAUSE
OF THE SHEER EFFORT REQUIRED IN
MAKING THE MIGRATION. AND THIS
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HUGE COST
SAVINGS ON COSTLY LICENSING FEES
ON TOP OF THE INHERENT
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY
BENEFITS. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE
OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION? ALL THE FOLKS IN
MARKETING, FINANCE, HR, PRODUCT
MANAGEMENT AND MORE? THERE'S SO
MUCH INFORMATION SPREAD ACROSS
YOUR ORGANIZATION'S DOCUMENTS,
VASS ALL OF YOUR DATA, ALL OF
YOUR APPLICATIONS, ASIANS AND
PEOPLE IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
ROLES, THEY STRUGGLE EVERY DAY
TO FIND THE INFORMATION THAT
THEY NEED TO AND THEN TRANSFORM
IT INTO MAKING DECISIONS AND
TAKING ACTIONS AND DOING THAT
FAST ENOUGH TO STAY COMPETITIVE,
OF FINDING RELEVANT INFORMATION,
MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS, TAKING
ACTION THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR,
RIGHT? YEP AMAZON. Q IS ALSO
YOUR BUSINESS EXPERT. Q HAS
CONNECTIONS TO OVER 40 POPULAR
ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS, SO EMPLOYEES
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION CAN ASK
COMPLEX QUESTIONS AND GET
DETAILED, ACCURATE, NUANCED
ANSWERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO
THEIR ROLE AT WORK. AND AGAIN,
SECURE IS SECURE AND Q IS SECURE
AND PRIVATE. IT RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING ROLES AND THE
PERMISSIONS THAT ARE GRANTED
UNIQUELY TO EACH USER. WE'RE
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, AND I
ACTUALLY WANTED TO SHOW YOU JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF AMAZON. Q AND
FOR YOUR BUSINESS IN ACTION. SO
TO PUT THROUGH Q PUT Q THROUGH
ITS PACES. PLEASE WELCOME AWS
OWN DR. MATT WOOD TO THE STAGE.
THANKS, ADAM, AND GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE. I'M EXCITED TO GIVE
YOU A FIRST LOOK AT AMAZON. Q A
NEW TYPE OF AI ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO BE AN EXPERT IN YOUR
BUSINESS WITH AMAZON. Q YOU CAN
GET QUICK, ACCURATE, RELEVANT
ANSWERS TO YOUR MOST PRESSING
BUSINESS QUESTIONS, ALL
DELIVERED SECURELY AND
PRIVATELY. GETTING STARTED WITH
Q IS SIMPLE AND TAKES JUST THREE
STEPS. FIRST, YOU CONFIGURE
AMAZON Q BY CONNECTING AND
CUSTOMIZING Q WITH DETAILS OF
YOUR OWN ORGANIZATION. THEN Q
CONNECTS TO EXISTING DATA
SOURCES LIKE S3 SALESFORCE,
MICROSOFT, GOOGLE SLACK AND MORE
SUPPORTING OVER 40 POPULAR
BUSINESS APPLICATIONS AND
SERVICES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.
ONCE CONNECTED AMAZON Q STARTS
INDEXING ALL OF YOUR DATA AND
CONTENT, LEARNING EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR
BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES
UNDERSTANDING THE CORE CONCEPT
PRODUCT NAMES, ORGANIZATION,
STRUCTURE, ALL THE DETAILS THAT
MAKE YOUR BUSINESS UNIQUE, AS
WELL AS INDEXING THE DATA FROM
THESE SOURCES. Q ALSO USES
GENERATIVE AI TO UNDERSTAND AND
CAPTURE THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION
WHICH MAKES YOUR BUSINESS
UNIQUE. THIS ADDITIONAL SEMANTIC
INFORMATION IS CAPTURED AS
VECTOR EMBEDDINGS, ALLOWING Q TO
PROVIDE HIGHLY RELEVANT RESULTS
WHICH ARE TAILORED TO YOUR
SPECIFIC COMPANY AND INDUSTRY.
YOUR DATA REMAINS COMPLETELY
UNDER YOUR CONTROL AT ALL TIMES.
AMAZON Q NEVER SHARES IT
EXTERNALLY OR USES IT TO IMPROVE
ANY OF THE UNDERLYING MODELS,
AND THAT'S IT. SURPRISE. THERE
IS NO STEP THREE. JUST OPEN
AMAZON Q IN YOUR BROWSER AND

THIS FRIENDLY WEB APPLICATION
DESIGNED FOR EVERYONE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION TO USE. Q KNOWS WHO
YOU ARE AND ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY
AND ROLE. AND BECAUSE Q
UNDERSTANDS YOUR BUSINESS
SEMANTICS, YOU CAN ASK FAR MORE
DETAILED AND NUANCED QUESTIONS
AND GET TAILORED ANSWERS FASTER
THAN EVER BEFORE FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK Q TO ANALYZE WHICH
PRODUCT FEATURES CUSTOMERS ARE
STRUGGLING WITH AND RECOMMEND
WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM AS SOON AS
YOU HIT ENTER. Q GETS TO WORK ON
UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION AND
PREPARING AN ANSWER. Q STARTS BY
CREATING A SET OF INPUT PROMPTS.
AUTOMATIC ALI. Q THEN USES ALL
OF THE BUSINESS CONTEXT
AVAILABLE TO FIND RELEVANT DATA,
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS AND
PICKS THE BEST ONES BEFORE
COMBINING EVERYTHING TOGETHER
INTO A RESPONSE, ALL IN JUST A
FRACTION OF A SECOND, USING THE
POWER OF GENERATIVE AI AMAZON Q
REMAINS FAITHFUL TO YOUR
ORIGINAL SOURCES, CITING THEM IN
LINE SO THAT YOU CAN VALIDATE
THE INFORMATION EASILY. Q'S
EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE MAGICAL, BUT
THERE IS NO MAGICAL BLACK BOX
JUST GIVING YOU ANSWERS. YOU CAN
UPLOAD NEW WORD DOCUMENTS TO
CSVS AND OTHER FILES ON THE FLY.
GO TO Q TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS
RESPONSES, LETTING YOU ASK
QUESTIONS ABOUT AD HOC DATA
WHICH HASN'T YET BEEN ADDED TO
ANY CORPORATE SYSTEM. AND AMAZON
Q WAS BUILT WITH PRIVACY AND
SECURITY IN MIND FROM THE GROUND
UP. SO EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SEEK
INFORMATION TO WHICH WE DON'T
HAVE ACCESS, AMAZON Q RESPECTS
YOUR EXISTING ACCESS CONTROLS
ONLY RETURNING INFORMATION
YOU'RE AUTHORIZED TO SEE. ADMINS
CAN ALSO RESTRICT SENSITIVE
TOPICS FILTERING OUT
INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS AND
ANSWERS WHERE NECESSARY. FINALLY
AMAZON Q CAN TAKE ACTIONS ON
YOUR BEHALF THROUGH A SET OF
CONFIGURABLE PLUGINS? AS AN
EXAMPLE, IF YOU UPDATE, SAY,
YOUR TRAINING PRIORITIES, Q CAN
AUTOMATICALLY CREATE TICKETS IN
JIRA. NOTIFY LEADERS IN SLACK
AND UPDATE DASHBOARDS IN
SERVICENOW. Q ALLOWS YOU TO
INSPECT ACTIONS BEFORE THEY RUN
SO YOU CAN REVIEW THEM AND ADD
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND
AFTER THE ACTION RUNS, Q WILL
LINK TO THE RESULTS FOR
VERIFICATION. SO IN SUMMARY,
AMAZON Q BRINGS AI ASSISTANT
INTO THE BUSINESS WORLD,
PROVIDING SECURE TO RELEVANT AND
ACTIONABLE GUIDANCE TAILORED
ENTIRELY TO YOUR COMPANY. WE
CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO TRY. Q AND
SEE HOW IT WILL HELP YOUR
ORGANIZATION WITH THAT. BACK TO
ADAM. THANKS A LOT. THAT WAS
AWESOME. AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
BUSINESSES. EMPLOYEES ARE GOING
TO LOVE AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS AND DISCOVER
AND SYNTHESIZE NEW INFORMATION
AND LIFT FOLKS OUT OF MONOTONOUS
DRAG OF REPETITIVE TASKS. AND IT
IS GOING TO LOVE HOW ALL OF THIS
COMES WITH RIGOROUS SECURITY AND
PRIVACY. NOW, I KNOW AT LEAST A
FEW OF YOU OUT THERE ARE
WONDERING IF AMAZON Q CAN ACCESS
MY DATA? DOES THAT MEAN IT CAN
HELP WITH MY BUSINESS
INTELLIGENCE? YES. AND OF COURSE
THE ANDREW NG ANSWER IS A
RESOUNDING YES. SO WE'VE BEEN
WORKING FOR A WHILE TO MAKE
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE MORE
ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WITHOUT BI
EXPERTISE. WE THINK ANYONE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS
OF THEIR DATA USING NATURAL
LANGUAGE AND SO AMAZON
QUICKSIGHT OUR ML POWER BI
SERVICE NOW HAS AMAZON Q
FEATURES BUILT IN FIRST AMAZON Q
IS GOING TO HELP REDUCE THE TIME
THAT IT TAKES BUSINESS ANALYSTS
TO CREATE DASHBOARDS AND REPORTS
FROM HOURS DOWN TO MINUTES BY
LETTING THEM SIMPLY TELL AMAZON
Q WHAT THEY WANT TO VISUALIZE.
FOR EXAMPLE, REGIONAL SALES BY
PRODUCT IS A SANKEY DIAGRAM. Q
COMES RIGHT BACK WITH THAT
DIAGRAM. UM, AND YOU CAN ADD IT
TO YOUR DASHBOARD WITH EASE AND
YOU CAN TELL. Q TO FURTHER
REFINE THE VISUAL, SAY YOU WANT
TO CHANGE THE CHART TO A
VERTICAL STACKED BAR CHART BY
MONTH AND COLOR CODED BY REGION.
YOUR WISH IS Q'S COMMAND. WITH
Q, YOU CAN GET BETTER DASHBOARDS
FASTER, BUT EVEN THE BEST
DASHBOARDS DON'T TELL EVERY
ANGLE OF THE STORY. FOR, FOR
EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ASK AMAZON. Q
WHERE DID WE HAVE THE HIGHEST
SALES? AND YOU GET A GET A
RESPONSE CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR
BUSINESS DATA. YOU CAN ASK A
FOLLOW UP QUESTION EVEN AS
LITTLE AS ONE WORD LIKE LONDON.
AND BECAUSE Q MAINTAINS THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR CURRENT
CONVERSATIONS, YOU CAN GET
INSIGHTS FROM YOUR DATA QUICKLY.
ORI NOW ENABLING PEOPLE TO TALK
TO Q AND QUICKSIGHT IS A BIG
STEP FORWARD IN HELPING YOUR
ORGANIZATION BE EVEN MORE DATA
DRIVEN. BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
GETTING HANDS ON WITH DATA. A
LOT OF PEOPLE CONSUME DATA
THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AND
REPORTS, AND SO, SO MUCH OF YOU
DO AT WORK IS TELLING STORIES
WITH DATA. AND AS YOUR BUSINESS
EXPERT, Q IS HERE TO MAKE THAT
EASIER TOO. LET'S SAY YOU WANT
TO CREATE A MONTHLY REPORT ON
YOUR BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA.
YOU CAN ASK YOU TO WRITE A
MONTHLY REPORT ABOUT THE
BUSINESS AND MAKE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT MONTH.
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU
VISUALIZATION OPTIONS. YOU
CHOOSE THE ONES YOU WANT, AND
THEN Q WILL FORMAT THEM. AND IN
SECONDS YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL AND
COMPELLING STORY AND IT'S
COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE. YOU CAN
ACTUALLY ADD MORE CONTEXT TO THE
SECTION BY ASKING YOU TO ADD A
VISUAL OF THE USAGE TREND, AND Q
WILL GENERATE A SHORT SUMMARY.
AND THEN YOU CAN FURTHER TWEAK
IT BY MAKING IT LONGER, SHORTER
OR REFORMATTING IT TO BULLETS.
LET'S MAKE IT LONGER. ONCE WE'RE
HAPPY WITH THE STORY, WE CAN
SECURELY SHARE IT WITH OTHERS.
WITH AMAZON Q AND QUICKSIGHT YOU
NOW HAVE AN EXPERT BI ASSISTANT
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR BUSINESS ANALYSTS AND IT'S
GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR END
USERS TO GET ANSWERS TO AND
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND THESE NEW Q
CAPABILITIES AND QUICKSIGHT ARE
AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW TODAY. NOW,
A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE
TARGETED TO HORIZONTAL USE CASES
OR SPECIFIC LINES OF BUSINESS
AND AWS HAS APPLICATIONS IN
THESE AREAS TOO. SO OUR FIRST
SPECIALIZED LINE OF BUSINESS
SOLUTION WAS AMAZON CONNECT. SO
IT'S BORN IN THE CLOUD AND OF
COURSE, AMAZON CONNECT IS A
SCALABLE COST EFFECTIVE, EASY TO
USE. CONTACT CENTER APPLICATION
THAT'S REINVENTED CUSTOMER
SERVICE GENERATIVE AI THAT KNOWS
YOUR BUSINESS IS GOING TO HAVE
AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON THE
WHOLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
EXPERIENCE ACROSS SO MANY
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. YOUR
CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAMS ARE AT
THE HEART OF YOUR BUSINESSES
DELIVERING INTERACTIONS THAT
PEOPLE REMEMBER FOR GOOD AND FOR
BAD. SO GETTING THIS RIGHT
REALLY MATTERS IS TODAY CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS SPEND A LOT OF
TIME GATHERING INFORMATION FROM
CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR
QUESTIONS AND THEN THEY SPEND
EVEN MORE TIME SEARCHING FOR THE
RIGHT ANSWER. NOW CONNECT HAS
MADE THIS A LOT EASIER ALREADY
WITH MACHINE LEARNING
TRANSCRIPTION ANALYTICS, BUT WE
KNEW WE COULD MAKE IT EVEN
BETTER FOR YOUR AGENTS AND
CERTAINLY FOR THE CUSTOMERS
WAITING ON THE OTHER END OF THE
LINE FOR HELP. ENTER AMAZON Q
AND CONNECT AVAILABLE TODAY AND
THIS IS GOING TO GIVE CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS A MAJOR ASSIST
AGENTS CAN CHAT WITH. Q DIRECTLY
INSIDE OF AMAZON CONNECT TO HELP
THEM RESPOND QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS. LIVE CHAT WITH Q WITH
FAST ANSWERS IS GREAT, BUT WHAT
IF YOU COULD MAKE THE CALL
ITSELF THE PROMPT NOW INSIDE OF
CONNECT? Q IS ACTUALLY THERE ON
THE CALLS ASSISTING WITH
PROPOSED RESPONSES WITH
SUGGESTED ACTIONS, WITH LINKS TO
RELEVANT ARTICLES? NO TYPING
REQUIRED, SO CONTACT CENTERS,
SUPERVISORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
ARE ALSO GOING TO GET A
GENERATIVE AI BOOST CONNECT NOW
AUTOMATICALLY CREATES POST CALL
SUMMARIES THAT SUPERVISORS CAN
USE TO TRACK FOLLOW UP ACTIONS
AND TO UNCOVER AGENT COACHING
OPPORTUNITIES. AND FOR
ADMINISTRATORS, CONNECT CAN SET
UP CHAT BOTS AND INTERACTIVE
VOICE RESPONSES THROUGH SIMPLE
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPTS.
STREAMLINE LEARNING THE PROCESS.
AMAZON Q IS JUST THE FIRST OF
MANY SPECIALIZED INDUSTRY AND
USE CASE SPECIFIC SERVICES THAT
ARE GOING TO SUPERCHARGE AMAZON
Q SO STAY TUNED. AMAZON

APPLICATIONS AND CAPABILITIES
THAT CAN BE ENRICHED WITH THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR BUSINESS. AND
IT'S ALL ON AWS BUILT WITH OUR
HIGH BAR THAT GIVES YOU BROAD
AND DEEP CAPABILITIES, CHOICE
AND ENTERPRISE READINESS. BUT
IT'S SO EARLY IN THE GAME AND
WE'RE INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
DO TOGETHER. NOW, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING THAT CUSTOMERS ARE
GOING TO NEED FOR ANY OF THIS TO
WORK, AND THAT'S DATA. YOUR
DATA. NO ONE ELSE HAS IT. NO ONE
ELSE CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU CAN
. YOUR DATA IS KEY TO SETTING
YOUR ORGANIZATION APART FROM THE
PACK. AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED,
GENERATIVE AI HAS JUST MADE IT
SO MUCH MORE RELEVANT AND
IMPACTFUL WHEN YOU TAILOR YOUR
DATA. SO LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM A
LONG TIME CUSTOMER ABOUT HOW
THEY'RE USING DATA TO CREATE
FIRST CLASS EXPERIENCES FOR
THEIR CUSTOMERS. SO PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE, STEPHANE
DURACH, VP OF CONNECTED COMPANY
AT BMW.
THANK YOU. HELLO EVERYONE. IT'S
FANTASTIC TO BE HERE. I COULDN'T
AGREE MORE DATA IS KEY. THE
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCT COMPLEXITY IS
STRONGLY INCREASED. KING AND
DEVELOPMENT SPEED IS ESSENTIAL.
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW BMW IS
MASTERING DATA ACCELERATING THE
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND
DELIVERING BEST IN CLASS
EXPERIENCE TO OUR CUSTOMER
ANYWHERE. AND ANYTIME ACROSS THE
ENTIRE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO FROM
BMW TO MINI AND EVEN ROLLS-ROYCE
, BMW IS PROVIDING GAME CHANGING
VEHICLE ENTERTAINMENT AND
EXPERIENCE POWERED BY AWS. WE
OPTIMIZE OUR TECH STACK, IMPROVE
OUR WORKFLOW AND USE DATA BY
LEVERAGING AWS CLOUD TECHNOLOGY.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES.
CLOUD DATA, BMW CENTRAL DATA
LAKE BUILT BY BMW AND AWS HOSTED
DATA FROM OUR CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET AND BY UPLOADING UPHOLDING
THE STRICTEST DATA PRIVACY
STANDARDS ON TOP OF IT, TEAMS
CAN BUILD THEIR APPLICATION AND
MODEL AS WELL AS DEPLOY UPDATES
AND IMPROVEMENTS TOGETHER. WE
ARE EXPLORING INNOVATIVE USE OF
MACHINE LEARNING, INCLUDING
AMAZON SAGEMAKER. THIS AUTOMATED
DRIVING PLATFORM IS BY BMW IS
BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF
DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEM ON
AWS. THIS AUTOMATED DRIVING
PLATFORM IS CAPABLE TO HANDLE
SEVERAL HUNDRED PETABYTE OF DATA
FROM OUR GLOBAL TEST FLEET. WE
ARE ACCELERATE TESTING OUR
DEVELOPMENT, SIMULATING AND
VALIDATION PROCESS DRAMATICALLY
FOR OUR PRODUCT LAUNCH IN 2025
WITH OUR ROUTE OPTIMIZED
CHARGING SERVICES, WE ARE
PROVIDING REAL TIME TRAFFIC
CALCULATION BASED ON DRIVING
STYLE PREFERENCE TRAFFIC OR
AVAILABLE CHARGING STATIONS AND
MANY MORE. WE ALSO USE AMAZON
TECHNOLOGY LIKE ALEXA FOR OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
AND FIRE TV TO CREATE UNIQUE
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, INSIGHT,
THE VEHICLE, OUR CONNECTED
VEHICLE AI PLATFORM IS BUILT ON
AWS AND FORMED THE BACKBONE OF
THE LARGEST CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET WHERE DE FOR SOME MORE
EVEN EYE OPENING STATS, LET'S
DIVE IN. 20 YEARS AGO BMW
INTRODUCED ITS FIRST VEHICLE
CONNECTED VEHICLE AND WE COME
QUITE A LONG WAY SINCE THEN. AND
NOW THE BMW GROUP HAS THE
LARGEST CONNECTED FLEET WITH
MORE THAN 20 MILLION VEHICLES
GLOBALLY OVER THE LAST THREE
YEARS. WE MIGRATED THE CONNECTED
VEHICLE BACKEND TO AWS BY
UTILIZING THE GLOBAL PRESENCE OF
AWS IN MANY REGIONS WORLDWIDE.
WE ARE UPDATE ADDING MORE THAN 6
MILLION VEHICLES OVER THE AIR ON
A REGULAR BASIS. THE THOSE
NUMBERS ARE GROWING CONSTANTLY.
IT REQUIRES TO MANAGE MORE THAN
12 BILLION REQUESTS PER DAY WITH
OVER 1000 DIFFERENT
MICROSERVICES. ULTIMATELY, WE
ARE PROCESSING MORE THAN 110TB
OF DATA TRAFFIC PER DAY WITH A
REMARKABLE RELIABILITY. LOOK AT
THESE NUMBERS. I'M ALWAYS
IMPRESSED, HOWEVER, WITH OUR NEW
PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE. THIS
NUMBER WILL TRIPLE IN THE NEXT
TWO YEARS. LET'S CHANGE
PERSPECTIVE AND TAKE A LOOK AT A
COUPLE OF NUMBERS IN THE
DEVELOPMENT PHASE. MORE THAN
8500 SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
WORLDWIDE CREATE FIRST CLASS
CODE FOR OUR VEHICLE AND
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE BMW SERIES
RUN SEVEN SERIES RUNS ON OVER
500 MILLION LINES OF CODE. OUR
WORLDWIDE DEV OPS TEAMS EXECUTE
MORE THAN 110 SOFTWARE, BUILDS
EVERY DAY BY USING MORE THAN
60,000 VIRTUAL CPUS TO KEEP UP
WITH OUR DEMAND. WE USE AWS
SERVICES TO SCALE UP AND
ACCELERATE DEVELOPMENT WHENEVER
IT IS NECESSARY. LET'S TAKE A
DEEPER LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT.
TRADITIONALLY, BMW'S COMES FROM
A HARDWARE DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
AND EVERY DEVELOPER HAD TO DO
THE DEVELOPMENT WORK ON A
PHYSICAL TEST TRACK. TODAY WE
ARE USING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY
TO STREAMLINE OUR INFOTAINMENT
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE NEW
APPROACH ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE
TEST FUNCTIONALITIES REMOTELY TO
OUR GLOBAL DEVELOPER TEAMS. AN
EXAMPLE IS USING AMAZON EC2 FOR
VIRTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE
CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COLLABORATION.
OUR NEXT STEP IS TO EXTEND THIS
APPROACH TO BUILD A FULLY
VIRTUAL DIGITAL TWIN. NOW LET'S
TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND SOME
EXCITING FEATURES WE CREATED FOR
OUR MINI CUSTOMERS. ON THE
PICTURE, YOU CAN SEE THE MINI
INTERIOR. IT'S OUR WAY TO
EMPHASIZE BRAND TYPICAL DESIGN.
TAKE THE IMPRESSIVE ROUND ALI
DISPLAY IN OUR NEW MINI FAMILY.
AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, OUR SPEECH
IS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE DOMINANT
MODALITY FOR INTERACTING WITH
VEHICLES. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY
INTEGRATING ALEXA VOICE
ASSISTANT. HOWEVER, THIS YEAR WE
ARE RAISING THE BAR. WE WILL USE
ALEXA TECHNOLOGY TO BRING OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL. NOW LET'S
TAKE A SEAT IN THE BACK OF OUR
SEVEN SERIES. ONE OF OUR MOST
EXCITING FEATURE IS THE BMW
THEATER SCREEN. IT'S THE 30 INCH
SCREEN WITH AN EIGHT K
RESOLUTION. IT IS SPECTACULAR,
INTEGRATED IN THE CAR. IT GIVES
YOU A REAL CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE
WITH FIRE TV. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN
SEAMLESSLY ENJOY THEIR FAVORITE
SERIES AND MOVIES. IT'S OUR
STRONG COLLABORATION WITH AWS
AND AMAZON THAT UNLOCKS NEW
POSSIBILITIES, ENABLE US TO
THINK ABOUT THE CAR IN A NEW
DIMENSION. SO ONE LAST THING TO
GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE INTO THE
FUTURE. THIS IS THE BMW NEW
CLASS. THIS WILL LAUNCH IN 2025.
BMW HAS BEEN ALWAYS ON THE
FOREFRONT OF AUTOMOTIVE
INNOVATION. THE NEW CLASS WILL
BE A QUANTUM LEAP IN CUSTOMER
EXPERIENCE. IT WILL TAKE THE
DRIVING EXPERIENCE TO A NEW
LEVEL AS YOU CAN SEE, THE NEW
CLASS INTRODUCED A COMPLETELY
NEW INTERIOR WITH THE BMW
PANORAMIC VISION. WE DEVELOPED A
NEW HEAD UP DISPLAY TO PROJECT
INFORMATION PILLAR TO PILLAR,
AND FOR THE PERFECT DRIVER
ORIENTATION AND USER EXPERIENCE.
ALL OF THIS EMPHASIZES IMPROVE.
BMW IS MASTERING DATA
ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT
PROCESS AND DELIVERING THE BEST
IN CLASS EXPERIENCE TO THE
CUSTOMER ANYWHERE AND ANYTIME
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EXCITING AND
ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT
NOW. AWS AND THE BMW GROUP ARE
WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER TO
SHAPE THIS FUTURE. THANK YOU
ALL. GOODBYE AND I'LL SEE YOU
SOON. FOR AN INCREDIBLE DATA
PLATFORM YOU'VE BUILT AND THE
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE IT'S
CREATING FOR YOUR CONSUMERS.
JUST AMAZING. THANK YOU, STEFAN.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU, AS
ALWAYS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO
AS STEFAN HAS JUST MADE SO
CLEAR, SUCCESS WITH AI AS WELL
AS WITH NEARLY EVERY OTHER
BUSINESS PRIORITY RELIES ON
HAVING A STRONG DATA STRATEGY.
AND ONE QUESTION I HEAR FROM
CUSTOMERS FREQUENTLY IS HOW
SHOULD I THINK ABOUT DATA IN A
GENERATIVE AI WORLD? WELL, THE
ANSWER IS THAT FOR GENERATIVE
AI, YOUR DATA IS YOUR
DIFFERENTIATOR. NOW WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT CUSTOMIZATION THROUGH
BEDROCK CODEWHISPERER
CUSTOMIZATIONS, AMAZON TAILORED
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND EXAMPLES
FROM DELTA AIRLINES AND PFIZER
ALL TAL ADDING CONTEXT TO YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA IS ABSOLUTELY
CRITICAL TO PROVIDING VALUE.
NOW, IN EACH OF THESE EXAMPLES,
ALS, THE DATA USED TO CUSTOMIZE
THE APPLICATION HAS TO BE UP TO
DATE. IT HAD TO BE COMPLETE AND
ACCURATE. IT HAD TO BE
DISCOVERABLE AND IT HAD TO BE
AVAILABLE WHEN YOU NEEDED IT. SO
THE FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING ALL
OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE YOUR
DATA IS IN THE CLOUD. NOW,
GENERATIVE AI IS JUST ONE OF
MANY REASONS THAT YOU WANT THIS.
HAVING EFFECTIVE CLOUD BASED
DATA STRATEGY IS GOING TO
INCREASE YOUR INSIGHT. IT'S
GOING TO REDUCE YOUR COST AND
IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE
INNOVATION. NOW, TO UNDERSTAND
THIS, JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MANY
DIFFERENT ISSUES THERE ARE TO
CONSIDER WHEN TRYING TO MAKE THE
MOST OF YOUR DATA. ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA. IT
COMES FROM DIFFERENT ORIGINS,
AND IT COMES AT VARIOUS SCALES
AND SPEEDS AS DIFFERENT TEAMS
ALL ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION ARE
GOING TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT
DATA IN MANY, MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF WAYS. AND THEN HOW YOU
WANT TO USE THIS DATA IS JUST AS
VARIED. YOUR STORING IT, YOUR
POWERING, YOUR APPLICATIONS,
YOUR ANALYZING IT, YOU'RE
GENERATING PREDICTIONS FROM IT.
THERE'S NO ONE TOOL OR SOLUTION
THAT CAN DO IT ALL UNLESS YOU'RE
WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES LIKE
PERFORMANCE COST OR
CAPABILITIES. BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE THOSE SACRIFICE CHOICES.
SO WHAT YOU NEED IS A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF TOOLS THAT
ACCOUNTS FOR THE SCALE AND THE
VARIETY OF THIS DATA AND THE
MANY, MANY PURPOSES FOR WHICH
YOU WANT TO USE IT. YOU NEED TO
INTEGRATE IT AND COMBINE ALL
THAT DATA THAT'S SPREAD ALL OVER
TO CREATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND PREDICT
WHAT WILL HAPPEN. AND OF COURSE,
YOU NEED GOVERNANCE SO THAT YOU
CAN HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE OF
ACCESS AND CONTROL EVERY STEP OF
THE WAY. YOU NEED IT ALL. IF YOU
MISS EVEN ONE ASPECT, YOUR
ABILITY TO USE THAT DATA IS
SIGNIFICANTLY HOBBLED. SO IN
ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN
STORE, ANALYZE AND PROCESS THE
DATA YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF DATA
SERVICES SO YOU CAN GET THE
PRICE PERFORMANCE, YOU CAN GET
THE SPEED, THE FLEXIBILITY AND
THE CAPABILITIES FOR YOUR USE
CASE. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
BUILT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SET
OF CLOUD DATA SERVICES OUT THERE
. SO TO START, WE HAVE AMAZON S3
AND CUSTOMERS USE S3 TO MAKE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DATA
LAKES WHERE THEY CAN BRING
STRUCTURED DATA TOGETHER WITH
UNSTRUCTURED DATA AND MAKE IT
ALL AVAILABLE FOR ANALYTICS AND
MACHINE LEARNING. WE ALSO OFFER
EIGHT RELATIONAL DATABASES,
INCLUDING AMAZON, AURORA THE
RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICE
THAT'S BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP
FOR THE CLOUD AND IS STILL THE
FASTEST GROWING SERVICE IN AWS
HISTORY. WE ALSO HAVE EIGHT
PURPOSE BUILT DATABASES, NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES, INCLUDING
AMAZON DYNAMODB, WHICH IS USED
BY OVER A MILLION DEVELOPERS
SORRY, A MILLION CUSTOMERS FOR
ITS SERVERLESS SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND PERFORMANCE AT ANY
SCALE. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE
BROADEST AND DEEPEST SET OF
ANALYTICS SERVICES AND THIS
INCLUDES OUR DATA WAREHOUSE
SERVICE, AMAZON REDSHIFT, WHICH
DELIVERS UP TO SIX OR EVEN SEVEN
TIMES BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
DEPENDING ON YOUR WORKLOAD THAN
OTHER CLOUD DATA WAREHOUSES.
WE'VE GOT AMAZON EMR TO EASILY
RUN SPARK AND OTHER BIG DATA
WORKLOADS AND AMAZON OPENSEARCH
SERVICE WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF ACTIVE CUSTOMERS AND HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF CLUSTERS UNDER
MANAGEMENT. AND THAT ALL
PROCESSES TRILLIONS OF REQUESTS
PER MONTH AND MANY, MANY, MANY
MORE ANALYTIC SERVICES. I WON'T
GO THROUGH THEM ALL, BUT YOU
NEED THIS BREADTH AND THIS DEPTH
OF CHOICE SO THAT YOU CAN NEVER
HAVE TO COMPROMISE ON COST, ON
PERFORMANCE OR ON SCALE, AND
INSTEAD YOU CAN CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOL FOR THE JOB. NOW, WE'VE
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT AI AND ML
EXTENSIVELY, SO I'M NOT GOING TO
DWELL ON THAT HERE. BUT YOU NEED
TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOLS TO FEED YOUR AI AND
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'RE
DOING IN YOUR BUSINESS. AND THE
SECOND THING THAT YOU NEED AS
YOU MOVE TO PUT DATA AT THE
CENTER OF YOUR BUSINESS IS TO
BREAK DOWN YOUR DATA SILOS. MOST
PEOPLE HAVE DATA SPREAD OUT ALL
OVER THE ORGANIZATION IN
DATABASES, ANALYTIC TOOLS, SAAS
APPLICATIONS, SPREADSHEETS AND
MORE. AND TO GET THE MOST VALUE
FROM YOUR DATA, YOU NEED TO BE
ABLE TO USE IT ALL. NO MATTER
WHERE IT LIVES. AND TO DO THIS
TODAY, MOST PEOPLE MOVE DATA
AROUND OR TRY TO CONNECT THE
VARIOUS SILOS USING A PROCESS
CALLED ETL OR EXTRACT, TRANSFORM
AND LOAD. YEAH, I SEE SOME OF
YOU FLINCHED WHEN I SAID THAT
BECAUSE YOU KNOW. RIGHT. YOU
KNOW EXACTLY HOW BAD THIS
PROCESS CAN BE. IT IS TEARING
ALL FIRST DEVELOPERS HAVE TO
DESIGN AN ETL PIPELINE
ARCHITECTURE. THEY HAVE TO
DECIDE WHERE TO EXTRACT THE DATA
FROM, AND IT'S OFTEN COMING FROM
MULTIPLE SOURCES. THEN THEY HAVE
TO WRITE CODE TO TRANSFORM THE
DATA AND REMOVE DUPLICATES. THEY
HAVE TO FILTER OUT OUTLIERS,
RETRIEVE MISSING DATA AND
IDENTIFY CORRUPTED DATA. AFTER
ALL THAT, YOU HAVE TO TRANSFORM.
YOU HAVE TO LOAD YOUR TRANSFORM
DATA TO ITS NEW DESTINATION,
WHICH ONCE AGAIN MEANS MORE CODE
TO WRITE. THEN, IF SOMETHING
CHANGES, LIKE A DATA ENGINEER
SWAPPING OUT A DATA TABLE OR
ADDING A NEW FIELD, YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK AGAIN AND UPDATE ALL OF
YOUR CODE ONCE MORE. IT IS
MONOTONOUS, IT IS TEDIOUS AND IT
IS JUST A WHOLE LOT OF UNFUN
WORK, WHICH IS WHY WE INTRODUCED
OUR VISION OF A ZERO ETL FUTURE
FOR AND IN THIS FUTURE YOU CAN
WAVE GOODBYE TO THE BORING,
FRUSTRATING PROCESS OF ETL. YOUR
DATA IS AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTED
FROM THE SOURCE TO THE
DESTINATION. IT'S THAT EASY AND
YOU GET YOUR DATA WHERE YOU NEED
IT WHEN YOU NEED IT. NO MORE
BUILDING AND MANAGING COMPLEX,
BRITTLE PROCESSES AND PIPELINES.
IT'S REALLY EXCITING. BUT IS IT
REAL? WELL, IS IT DOWN PAYMENT?
LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED A FULLY
MANAGED ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
BETWEEN AURORA, MYSQL AND
REDSHIFT. WITHIN SECONDS OF DATA
BEING WRITTEN INTO AURORA, YOU
CAN USE REDSHIFT TO DO NEAR REAL
TIME ANALYTICS AND ON PETABYTES
OF DATA. YOU CAN ENABLE THIS
INTEGRATION WITH JUST A FEW
CLICKS AND ZERO-ETL. IT IS
INCREDIBLY EASY NOW THIS FIRST
ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IS READY,
IS READY DONE. BUT WE'VE WE'VE
WE WANT TO DELIVER SO MUCH MORE.
AND SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TODAY
TO BE ANNOUNCING THREE MORE ZERO
ETL INTEGRATIONS WITH REDSHIFT.
LET'S GET THEM ALL DONE AT ONCE.
AURORA POSTGRES RDS FOR MYSQL
AND DYNAMODB. THESE ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS AND AMAZON REDSHIFT
ARE ALL AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW
WHEN TODAY. SO. SO THAT MAKES.
YEAH. YOU DON'T LIKE THE MUCK,
DO YOU? SO THAT'S FOUR OF OUR
MOST POPULAR RELATIONAL AND NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES TOGETHER
WITH THE DATA WAREHOUSE THAT
GIVES YOU THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITHOUT ANY OF THE
ETL FANTASTIC. BUT REMEMBER,
WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THIS VISION.
SO OF COURSE OUR NEXT QUESTION
WAS, WELL, WHERE ELSE COULD WE
BE REMOVING THE PAIN OF ETL?
NOW, MANY OF YOU NEED TO USE
SEARCH ON YOUR TRANSACTIONAL
DATA TO ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE
OF YOUR APPLICATION. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE AN
E-COMMERCE APPLICATION AND YOU
WANT TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED
RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOUR USER,
YOU USE SIMILARITY SEARCH ON
TRANSACTION DATA. THAT'S GOING
TO BE STORED IN YOUR DATABASE.
SO TO DO THIS CURRENTLY YOU'RE
DESIGNING, YOU'RE BUILDING,
YOU'RE MANAGING COMPLEX DATA
PIPELINE ARCHITECTURES FROM YOUR
DATABASE TO A SEARCH ENGINE. AND
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOU ARE
BUILDING THOSE PIPELINES TO
AMAZON OPENSEARCH SERVICE FOR
ITS POWERFUL SEARCH CAPABILITIES
. I BET YOU CAN TELL WHERE WE'RE
GOING WITH THIS. SO TODAY I'M
REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE UNVEILED
ONE MORE ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IN
DYNAMO. DB ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
WITH OPENSEARCH SERVICE
GENERALLY AVAILABLE TODAY. AND
THIS NEW INTEGRATION MAKES IT SO
EASY TO SEARCH DYNAMODB DATA
WITH OUR OPENSEARCH SERVICE. AND
IT'S JUST THE FIRST OF THESE
DATABASE INTEGRATIONS TO OUR
OPENSEARCH SERVICE THAT'S GOING
TO HELP YOU DO MORE WITH DATA.
SO OUR NEW ZERO-ETL INTEGRATIONS
ARE BRINGING TRANSACTIONAL DATA
AND ANALYTICS TOGETHER FASTER
AND MORE EASILY AND CUSTOMERS
ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE
IDEA OF A ZERO-ETL FUTURE. SO
YOU CAN BE CERTAIN WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP INNOVATING HERE. NOW
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE
TOOLS THAT YOU NEED AND HOW YOU
CAN HAVE DATA WHERE YOU NEED IT
WITHOUT THE PAINFUL ETL BURDEN.
NEXT YOU WANT TO EMPOWER PEOPLE
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION TO USE
YOUR DATA TO ITS FULLEST AND YOU
WANT THEM WALLOWING IN YOUR
DATA, EXPERIMENTING, ASKING
QUESTIONS, SPARKING IDEAS. AND
YOU WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS.
BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM YOUR
DATA IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE, SO
YOU WANT TO GRANT ACCESS ONLY TO
THE RIGHT EMPLOYEES AT THE RIGHT
TIME. YOU NEED TO KEEP IT SAFE
AND SECURE. SO YOU ALSO NEED
CONTROL, YOUR ACCESS CONTROL.
KOHL THESE ARE OPPOSITES, RIGHT?
NO, YOU CAN HAVE IN FACT, YOU
MUST HAVE BOTH AND THE KEY TO
MAKING SURE THAT YOUR DATA IS,
IS SAFE, IS GOVERNED, HAS ACCESS
, IS GOVERNANCE CREATING
VISIBILITY INTO YOUR DATA AND
CONTROLLING WHO CAN ACCESS YOUR
DATA AND WHEN THEY CAN ACCESS IT
WITH ROBUST GOVERNANCE, YOU'RE
GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO
THE DATA THEY NEED AND ONLY THAT
DATA. AND WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT
DATA YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW WHERE IT
IS. YOU HAVE GUARDRAILS AND
TOOLS IN PLACE TO SAFELY UNLOCK
IT. THAT BUILDS CONFIDENCE. AND
THEN PEOPLE WITHIN THE
ORGANIZATION DEVELOP TRUST IN
THE DATA. YOU ACTUALLY EMPOWER
INNOVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION
RATHER THAN STIFLING IT. AND SO
TO HELP YOU WITH GOVERNANCE, WE
DEVELOPED AMAZON DATAZONE DATA
ZONES, A DATA MANAGEMENT SERVICE
THAT HELPS YOU CATALOG,
DISCOVER, SHARE AND GOVERN DATA
ACROSS YOUR ORGANIZATION. WE'RE
GETTING GREAT FEEDBACK FROM LOTS
OF DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
LEADER IN BRAZIL, ITAU. AND
WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE
IMPACT THAT DATA ZONE IS HAVING
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY IN THIS SPACE.
TODAY, DATA ZONE USES MACHINE
LEARNING TO AUTOMATICALLY ADD
METADATA TO YOUR CATALOG, BUT IN
ORDER TO FIND THE RIGHT DATA AT
THE RIGHT TIME, CUSTOMERS STILL
HAVE TO CHOOSE TO ADD BUSINESS
CONTEXT LIKE EXPLAINING THE
DATA'S PURPOSE OR CLARIFYING THE
COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS. AND NOW
THIS HELPS EMPLOYEES FIND THE
DATA THAT THEY NEED. IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
KNOW THE DATA EXISTS, THE
QUESTION OF ACCESS AND CONTROL
BECOMES MOOT. BUT ADDING ALL
THIS DATA IS A METADATA IS
TEDIOUS. IT'S A MANUAL PROCESS.
WELL, NO LONGER. WE'RE MAKING
YOUR CATALOGING EVEN SMARTER.
AND TODAY I'M REALLY PLEASED TO
ANNOUNCE A NEW CAPABILITY THAT
AUTOMATICALLY SUGGESTS BUSINESS
DESCRIPTIONS TO ADD CONTEXT FOR
YOUR DATA SET IN JUST A FEW
CLICKS, CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS
SIMPLY CHOOSE A DATA SET AND
DATAZONE WILL USE GENERATIVE AI
TO CREATE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS
FOR YOUR DATA. USING OUR TRAINED
MODELS. MAKING IT EASIER TO
UNDERSTAND THESE DESCRIPTIONS
CAN BE REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED, OR
EVEN FURTHER CLARIFIED OR EDITED
FOR YOUR EXACT PREFERENCES. DATA
ZONES ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO USE
YOUR DATA. THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE
TIME SAVER IN THIS CAPABILITY IS
GOING TO HELP EMPLOYEES TO FIND
THE RIGHT DATA FOR EVEN FASTER
INSIGHTS. WE'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE TO HELP YOU
USE DATA GOVERNANCE TO SET YOUR
DATA FREE. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
DO IN YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED AN
END TO END DATA STRATEGY THAT
PROVIDES CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE
ENTIRE SPAN OF YOUR DATA NEEDS.
YOU NEED TO EASILY CONNECT DATA
ACROSS SILOS AND YOU NEED YOU
NEED YOUR DATA TO BE GOVERNED TO
BE CONFIDENT THAT THE RIGHT DATA
IS USED IN THE RIGHT WAYS BY
ONLY THE RIGHT PEOPLE. WE'RE
MAKING AWS THE BEST PLACE FOR
ALL OF YOUR DATA NEEDS ACROSS
ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS.
AND WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS AND
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO MAKE DATA,
YOUR DIFFERENTIATOR IN AI AND
ACROSS YOUR BUSINESS, IT'S
AMAZING. WE'VE TALKED A LOT
ABOUT REINVENTION TODAY AND HERE
AT AWS THE MOST IMPORTANT
REINVENTION OF ALL IS YOURS TO
SUPPORT YOU IN ALL THE WAYS THAT
YOU WANT TO ADAPT AND EVOLVE. WE
CONTINUOUSLY CONTINUE TO
CHALLENGE OURSELVES. WE TRY AND
THINK DIFFERENTLY. WE TRY AND
GIVE YOU THE CAPABILITY WIZ THAT
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED, AND EVEN
SOME MAYBE THAT YOU'VE NEVER
IMAGINED. NOW, THIS ISN'T THE
WORK OF A FEW MONTHS OR EVEN A
YEAR, BUT WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT.
WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE AT
AMAZON WE MAKE BOLD BETS. SO
THIRD PARTY SELLING ON AMAZON
PRIME, EVEN AWS ITSELF IS A BIG
BET. I MEAN, IT TOOK A LOT OF
YEARS AND A LOT OF CAPITAL TO
BUILD OUT THE ON DEMAND
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES THAT
SIMPLY BECAME KNOWN AS THE CLOUD
FOR THIS LONG TERM FOCUS IS A
GOOD THING. BEING WILLING TO
THINK DIFFERENTLY AND LONG TERM
IS A GOOD THING. IT'S THE ONLY
PREDICTABLE WAY TO PROFOUNDLY
CHANGE WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR
CUSTOMERS. AWS. NOW THERE'S
ANOTHER BIG BET THAT AMAZON IS
MAKING YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF
PROJECT KUIPER AND YEAH, KUIPER.
KUIPER'S BUILDING A
CONSTELLATION OF THOUSANDS OF
LOW EARTH ORBIT SATELLITES. WHY?
WELL, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE ON EARTH LACK FAST OR
RELIABLE OR EVEN ANY INTERNET
ACCESS. PROJECT KUIPER IS GOING
TO HELP CLOSE THAT DIGITAL
DIGITAL DIVIDE BY DELIVERING
FAST, AFFORDABLE BROADBAND TO A
WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS
OPERATING IN PLACES WITHOUT
RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTIONS.
IN FACT, JUST LAST MONTH, KUIPER
, THE KUIPER TEAM SUCCESSFULLY
LAUNCHED ITS FIRST TWO PROTOSTAR
SATELLITES INTO ORBIT. IT'S JUST
INCREDIBLE THING. I MEAN, THEY
PUT SATELLITES UP THERE. THEY'RE
WORKING FLAWLESSLY. EVERYBODY'S
REALLY HAPPY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED
THERE RIGHT? WOW I MEAN, KUIPER
IS A GLOBAL HIGH SPEED SATELLITE
NETWORK THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE
COVERAGE IN PLACES THAT HAVE
NEVER HAD COVERAGE BEFORE. I
MEAN, IMAGINE THE POWER OF
DELIVERING A REALLY HARD TO
REACH PLACES, THE ABILITY TO
ACCESS THE INTERNET WITH THE
SAME SPEED. THE SAME RELIABILITY
THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED
EVERY DAY. NOW, THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR CONSUMERS IS,
FOR SURE, ENORMOUS. BUT SO ARE
THE BENEFITS TO BUSINESSES AND
GOVERNMENTS. AND THERE ARE ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES LIKE
RENEWABLE ENERGY PROVIDERS THAT
WANT TO ANALYZE IN REAL TIME
DATA FROM OFF SHORE WIND FARMS
OR FIRST RESPONDERS WHO NEED
FAST, RELIABLE CONNECTIONS
DURING NATURAL DISASTERS OR
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LOOKING
FOR CONNECTIVITY, BACKUP IN CASE
OF AN UNPLANNED OUTAGE. KUIPER
IS GOING TO HELP TO MAKE ALL OF
THIS POSSIBLE AND AWS CUSTOMERS
ARE ALREADY PLANNING FOR THE
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS OPENS UP
TO CONNECT TO THEIR FACILITIES,
THEIR SENSORS, THEIR DATA, THEIR
NETWORKS. IT'S GOING TO BE
AMAZING FOR SO MANY CUSTOMERS,
BUT SOME CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
DON'T WANT THEIR DATA RUNNING
OVER THE PUBLIC INTERNET. AND AS
YOU KNOW, SECURITY IS ALWAYS OUR
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. SO TODAY,
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THAT IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, KUIPER IS
ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE ENTERPRISE
READY PRIVATE CONNECTIVITY
SERVICES. AND NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE DATA FROM
VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE OVER PRIVATE
SECURE CONNECTIONS. AND AS YOU
USE USE THESE CONNECTIONS WITH
YOUR DATA, YOU CAN USE IT INSIDE
OF THE AWS CLOUD TO AN EARLY
ADOPTERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
START TESTING IN THE SECOND HALF
OF 2024. SO WE MAKE BIG BETS
LIKE THESE SO THAT CUSTOMERS CAN
DO THINGS THAT THEY COULDN'T
IMAGINE BEFORE. AND YOU COME ON
THIS JOURNEY WITH US BECAUSE
WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THESE
KINDS OF AUDACIOUS LEAPS AND THE
BENEFITS HAVE BEEN ENORMOUS. THE
EXCITING CHALLENGE AHEAD OF ALL
OF US THIS NEXT YEAR IS TO LOOK
CLOSELY AT OUR WORK AND TO
REIMAGINE IT, TO REINVENT IT, TO
DREAM UP EXPERIENCES THAT WERE
PREVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE AND MAKE
THEM REAL. WE ARE SO EXCITED TO
BE YOUR PARTNER IN THIS NEW
WORLD THAT WE'RE BUILDING
TOGETHER, AND I'M THRILLED THAT
WE GET TO EXPLORE IT. ALL THIS
WEEK. THIS MORNING. IT'S BEEN
INCREDIBLE. I WANT TO THANK ALL
OF MY GUESTS ON STAGE TODAY AND
THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WATCHING
AND OF COURSE, THANK YOU TO THE
WHOLE AWS TEAM FOR WORKING SO
HARD TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. NOW,
THE TEAM DOES HAVE ONE MORE
LITTLE SURPRISE UP UP THEIR
COLLECTIVE SLEEVE. SO I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE VERY
BEGINNING I MENTIONED LOUD AND
GUITARS IN IRELAND, BUT WE
ACTUALLY HAVE A LOUD GUITAR HERE
FROM OUR FRIENDS AT LOUDEN AND
WE'VE INVITED A TALENTED
GUITARIST A LONG TIME AWS
FAVORITE ZACH PERSON TO PLAY US
OUT. SO WE HAVE GOT A GREAT
CONFERENCE HERE FOR YOU THIS
WEEK. NOW LET'S GET OUT THERE
AND REINVENT. THANK YOU. NOW
TAKE IT AWAY, ZACH.
PLEASE WELCOME THE CEO OF AWS,
ADAM SELIPSKY.
GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE
12TH ANNUAL REINVENT. I AM SO
HAPPY TO BE HERE WITH MORE THAN
50,000 OF YOU HERE IN LAS VEGAS
AND MORE THAN 300,000 WATCHING
AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR
JOINING. THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU
. NOW, WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THIS
EVENT JUST A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENTLY AND REINVENT REMAINS
ABOVE ALL, A LEARNING
CONFERENCE, A LEARNING EVENT,
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN
AND GROW HERE ARE EVERYWHERE.
WE'VE GOT MORE THAN 2200
SESSIONS, AND YOU CAN CONNECT
WITH AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
PARTNERS IN THE EXPO ALL AROUND.
AND OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY,
MANY OPPORTUNITY WIZ TO CONNECT
WITH FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE AWS
COMMUNITY. SO WE'VE ALSO GOT A
GREAT SLATE OF KEYNOTES FOR YOU.
YESTERDAY, LAST NIGHT, HOPEFULLY
A LOT OF YOU SAW PETER DIVE INTO
ALL OF OUR INNOVATION AROUND
SERVERLESS. AND TOMORROW WE'VE
GOT SWAMI ON AI AND MACHINE
LEARNING AS WELL AS RUBA'S
PARTNER KEYNOTE. AND THEN OF
COURSE, WERNER CAPS OFF THE WEEK
ON THURSDAY. BUT I'M EXTREMELY
EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE IN
STORE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW HERE
TODAY. SO LET'S GET STARTED. SO
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT
REINVENT IS THE SHEER VARIETY OF
THE CUSTOMERS THAT I GET TO
MEET. I MEAN, FOLKS FROM EVERY
INDUSTRY, EVERY REGION, EVERY
USE CASE. AND THERE'S JUST
NOTHING LIKE IT ANYWHERE FOR AN
INNOVATORS ALL OVER THE WORLD
ARE RELYING ON AWS TO DRIVE
THEIR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING
LEADING ENTERPRISES FROM ACROSS
EVERY INDUSTRY, JUST TO NAME A
FEW IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE'RE
WORKING WITH JPMORGAN CHASE.
WE'RE WORKING WITH GOLDMAN
SACHS, NASDAQ, FIDELITY, ALLIANZ
ITYOU, BBVA, HSBC, GE CAPITAL
ONE, S&P GLOBAL NUBANK AND MORE.
IN HEALTH CARE, WE'RE WORKING
WITH PFIZER, GILEAD, MERCK, NOVO
NORDISK ROCHE, MODERNA, ILLUMINA
. MEDTRONIC 3M HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MORE. IN
AUTOMOTIVE, WE'RE WORKING WITH
EVERYBODY FROM BMW TO STELLANTIS
HONDA, TOYOTA, VW GROUP, NISSAN,
HYUNDAI, FORD MOTOR COMPANY,
MERCEDES BENZ, AND OF COURSE,
MORE. SO MANY AMAZING CUSTOMERS
AND PARTNERS AND STILL JUST A
SMATTERING OF THE LEADERS WE'RE
WORKING WITH TO SHAPE THE
FUTURES OF THESE INDUSTRIES. AND
ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
THAT THEY SERVE. ONE CUSTOMER
AND PARTNER. WE'VE BEEN WORKING
CLOSELY WITH FOR A NUMBER OF
YEARS IS SALESFORCE. SO IN 2016,
SALESFORCE CHOSE AWS AS THEIR
PRIMARY CLOUD PROVIDER, AND
TODAY SALESFORCE USES AWS
COMPUTE STORAGE DATA SERVICE AS
MANY OTHERS TO POWER KEY
SERVICES LIKE SALESFORCE, DATA
CLOUD AND MANY OTHERS. AND
YESTERDAY WE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
OUR PARTNERSHIP TO BRING NEW
CAPABILITIES TO OUR MUTUAL
CUSTOMERS. SALESFORCE IS GOING
TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
ITS ALREADY VERY LARGE USE OF
AWS. AWS WILL BE USING MORE
SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGIES AND
WE'RE MAKING IT EASIER FOR
DEVELOPERS TO QUICKLY BUILD AND
DEPLOY GENERATIVE AI
APPLICATIONS. JENS BY BRINGING
TOGETHER AMAZON BEDROCK WITH
SALESFORCE'S EINSTEIN PLATFORM.
WE'RE ALSO HELPING TO UNIFY DATA
MANAGEMENT WITH OUR NEW ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS BETWEEN SALESFORCE
DATA CLOUD AND AWS STORAGE AND
COMPUTE AND DATA SERVICE DATA
AND ANALYTICS SERVICES. SO THE
CUSTOMERS CAN GET EVEN BETTER
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND WE'RE ALSO
BUILDING TIGHTER INTEGRATIONS
BETWEEN SERVICE CLOUD FROM
SALESFORCE AND AMAZON CONNECT.
ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME,
SALESFORCE IS GOING TO BE
PUTTING ITS PRODUCTS ON THE
MARKET PLACE, MAKING IT EVEN
EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO FIND, TO
BUY AND TO MANAGE SALESFORCE
OFFERINGS. SO WITH THIS EXPANDED
PARTNERSHIP AND SALESFORCE
CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO GET NEW,
POWERFUL WAYS TO INNOVATE AND
BUILD APPLICATIONS. BUT IT'S NOT
JUST GLOBAL ENTERPRISE IS THE
MOST PROMISING UP AND COMER ALSO
CONTINUE TO CHOOSE AWS AS WELL.
ACCORDING TO PITCHBOOK, THERE
ARE MORE THAN 1000 UNICORNS OR
STARTUPS WITH OVER $1 BILLION IN
VALUATION, AND THE VAST MAJORITY
OF UNICORNS OVER 80% CHOOSE AWS
LIKE WIZ, A CLOUD SECURITY
COMPANY AND GREAT AWS PARTNER.
WIZ IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST CYBER
SECURITY UNICORN AND FASTEST
SAAS COMPANY. TO REACH A $10
BILLION VALUATION. REALLY
AMAZING OR ULTIMATE GENOMICS,
ONE OF FAST COMPANY'S MOST
INNOVATIVE COMPANIES IN BIOTECH
AND ULTIMO IS REVOLUTIONIZING
DNA SEQUENCING BY REDUCING THE
COST OF SEQUENCING SIX FOLD OR
PLAID PLAIDS. A DATA STARTUP
THAT POWERS FINTECH TOOLS LIKE
VENMO, ACORN AND ROBINHOOD THAT
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE USING TO
MANAGE THEIR FINANCES. CUSTOMERS
OF EVERY SIZE, EVERY INDUSTRY,
ORI, EVERY REGION, ORGANIZATIONS
YOU MIGHT NEVER IMAGINE CHAN
WOULD RELY ON THE CLOUD ARE
INNOVATING ON AWS. I JUST
RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT LOUDEN
GUITARS, A K10 EXPERT GUITAR
MAKER LOCATED IN A TINY VILLAGE
IN IRELAND, AND THEY'RE USING
AWS TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN
ELECTRONIC PASSPORT PROGRAM
THAT'S GOING TO EASE THE PASSAGE
OF THEIR VERY SPECIAL GUITARS
FOR MUSICIANS AS THEY TRAVEL
THROUGH CUSTOMS. I MEAN, ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES. IT'S AMAZING
ENTERPRISE WIZ AND STARTUPS,
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED
BUSINESSES, UNIVERSITIES,
COMMUNITY COLLEGES, GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, NONPROFITS. THE CLOUD
IS FOR ANYONE AND OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE SOLVING BIG PROBLEMS,
SERVING CRITICAL NEEDS AND
DREAMING UP THE WORLD'S NEXT BIG
THING. THEY COUNT ON US TO BE
SECURE, TO BE RELIABLE, TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY, TO DELIGHT
THEIR CUSTOMERS AND ENABLE NEW
WAYS TO GROW THEIR BUSINESSES.
ALL ALL ON AWS. SO WHY IS ALL
THIS HAPPENING? ON AWS, WE ARE
RELENTLESS ABOUT WORKING
BACKWARDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS
NEEDS AND FROM THEIR PAIN
POINTS. AND OF COURSE WE WERE
THE FIRST BY ABOUT 5 TO 7 YEARS
TO HAVE THIS BROADEST AND
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES THAT
WE STILL HAVE TODAY. AND WE'RE
THE MOST SECURE AND THE MOST
RELIABLE, BUT WE ALSO THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS
PROBLEMS AND THEIR POTENTIAL.
AND THIS HAS LED US TO REINVENT
CONTINUOUS ALI, TO PUSH THROUGH
THE BARRIERS OF WHAT PEOPLE
THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. SO YOU CAN
DO THE SAME. REINVENTING IS IN
OUR DNA AND IT CONTINUES TO
DRIVE US EVERY DAY. AFTER ALL,
THIS IS HOW CLOUD COMPUTING CAME
TO BE. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF
OPERATING OPERATING AMAZON.COM.
WE EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND HOW
HARD, HOW EXPENSIVE IT WAS TO
PROVISION AND MANAGE
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW MUCH OF
THE UNDIFFERENTIATED HEAVY
LIFTING THERE WAS THAT
DISTRACTED, REALLY TALENTED
TEAMS FROM REALLY INNOVATING. SO
WE SET OUT TO RETHINK IT.
INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETELY WITH
AWS. SO EVERYONE, EVEN A KID AND
A COLLEGE DORM ROOM, COULD HAVE
ACCESS TO THE SAME POWERFUL
TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO THE
LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED
ORGANIZATIONS. ALL ON DEMAND,
ALL SECURE, ALL RELIABLE AND ALL
COST EFFECTIVE. NOW IF FOLKS GOT
PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AS
THEY MOVED INTO THE CLOUD, SOME
EVEN HOSTED DATA CENTER CLOSING
PARTIES AND POSTED VIDEOS OF
SHUTTING DOWN SERVER ROOMS. IT
WAS REALLY, REALLY FUN. THIS WAS
FUN FOR US. SO WE INVENTED
REINVENTED INFRASTRUC FROM THE
GROUND UP TO OPTIMIZE AWS FOR
SCALE, FOR SECURITY, FOR
RELIABILITY, FROM ROUTERS TO
COOLING SYSTEMS TO NETWORKING
PROTOCOLS. AND BECAUSE WE LOOK
AT THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, OUR
GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE WAS
FUNDAMENTALLY DISTINCT FROM THAT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS. AND
THAT IS STILL TRUE TODAY. FOR
EXAMPLE, THE AWS GLOBAL
INFRASTRUCTURE SPANS 32
GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AROUND THE
WORLD AND WE'VE ANNOUNCED PLANS
FOR FIVE OR SO MORE EACH AND
EVERY REGION CONSISTS OF THREE
OR MORE AVAILABILITY ZONES OR
AZS AND NO OTHER CLOUD PROVIDER
PROVIDES THAT IN EVERY SINGLE
GEOGRAPHIC REGION. AND THIS IS
CRITICAL WITH EACH REGION. THE
AZS ARE PHYSICALLY SEPARATED BY
A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE UP TO 60
MILES OR 100KM. AND THEN THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH REDUNDANT
FIBER NETWORK THAT PROVIDES
SINGLE DIGIT MILLISECOND
LATENCY. NOW EACH AZ IS AT LEAST
ONE FULLY DISCRETE DATA CENTER
WITH ITS OWN REDUNDANT POWER
WATER FOR NETWORKING AND
CONNECTIVITY. SO IF THERE'S A
UTILITY FAILURE, UNEXPECTED
TRAFFIC SPIKE, HUMAN MISTAKE OR
EVEN A NATURAL DISASTER, THE
REGION REMAINS OPERATIONAL AND
SO DO YOUR APPLICATIONS. NOW,
OTHERS WOULD HAVE YOU THINK THAT
ALL CLOUDS ARE THE SAME, BUT
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. I MEAN,
IMAGINE IF YOU HAD A REGION
SUPPORTED BY A SINGLE DATA
CENTER OR IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR
PROVIDER HAD MULTIPLE AZS IN
FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND YOU
WERE RESILIENT. BUT IT TURNED
OUT THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THE
SAME LOCATION. I MEAN, ONE
INCIDENT LIKE A WATER LEAK
FOLLOWED BY A FIRE COULD TAKE
DOWN AN ENTIRE REGION FOR DAYS
DUE. HAVING THE BROADEST AND THE
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES
MATTERS LIKE HAVING THREE TIMES
THE THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF
DATA CENTERS COMPARED TO THE
NEXT LARGEST CLOUD PROVIDER,
WHICH MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN
CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY AND
HAVING 60% MORE SERVICES IN OVER
40% MORE FEATURES THAN THE NEXT
CLOSEST CLOUD PROVIDER. SO YOU
CAN INNOVATE WITHOUT
CONSTRAINTS. WE REINVENT IT SO
THAT YOU CAN REINVENT, TAKE
STORAGE, FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE
CERTAINLY DIDN'T INVENT STORAGE,
BUT WE REINVENTED HOW PEOPLE
CONSUME AND SCALE STORAGE IN THE
CLOUD WITH OUR VERY FIRST CLOUD
SERVICE, AMAZON S3, SIMPLE
STORAGE SERVICE SO BACK IN THE
DAY, STORAGE WAS PRIMARILY DISK
ARRAYS, WHICH COULD TAKE WEEKS
TO PROVISION AND OBVIOUSLY HAD
FINITE CAPACITY. SO S3 PROVIDED
HIGHLY DURABLE, HIGHLY
PERFORMANT OBJECT STORAGE THAT
CUSTOMERS COULD SCALE INSTANTLY
AND NEARLY INFINITELY. AND I
REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT S3 AT OUR
VERY FIRST TRADE SHOW IN 2006,
ON THE DAY THAT IT LAUNCHED, AND
FOLKS HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING
THE COST. I MEAN, IT WAS SO
DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN WHAT
THEY WERE USED TO, BUT WE KEPT
GOING. WE ADDED A WHOLE LOT OF
STORAGE TIERS, INCLUDING S3
GLACIER, DEEP ARCHIVE, WHICH
DELIVERS ARCHIVE STORAGE AT LESS
THAN A 10TH OF A CENT PER
GIGABYTE. BUT WHY SHOULD YOU
HAVE TO EVEN FIGURE OUT WHICH
STORAGE TIER TO USE? SO WE BUILT
S3 INTELLIGENT-TIERING TO
OPTIMIZE STORAGE BY
AUTOMATICALLY MOVING DATA TO THE
MOST EFFECTIVE ACCESS TIER WHEN
ACCESS PATTERNS CHANGE.
INTELLIGENT-TIERING HAS ALREADY
SAVED CUSTOMERS. YOU READY? OVER
$2 BILLION, BUT IT'S JUST
STORAGE, RIGHT? I MEAN, HERE'S
TO THE SAVINGS. BUT STORAGE,
RIGHT? I MEAN, SURELY THIS CAN'T
BE AN AREA THAT'S READY FOR MORE
REINVENTION. WELL, RECENTLY
WE'VE BEEN RETHINKING STORAGE
FOR YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED AND MOST LATENCY
SENSITIVE WORKLOADS, WORKLOADS
THAT NEED HIGH PERFORMANCE
ANALYTICS PROCESSING, LIKE
FINANCIAL TRADING ANALYTICS,
REAL TIME ADVERTISING, FRAUD
DETECTION AND MACHINE LEARNING
TRAINING. NOW THESE WORKLOADS
ACCESS DATA UP TO MILLIONS OF
TIMES IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AND
DO REQUIRE SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. AND SO
TODAY WHAT HAPPENS IS CUSTOMERS
MOVE DATA OFTEN FROM S3 TO
CUSTOM CACHING SOLUTIONS AND
THEN RUN ANALYTICS AT THESE
SPEEDS. BUT MANAGING MULTIPLE
STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURES AND APIS
ADDS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY. SO WE
LOOKED HARD AT WHAT WE COULD DO
TO ADD TO S3 OKAY, ARE YOU READY
FOR THE FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF
THE DAY? OKAY SO TODAY I'M
EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE AMAZON S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE, A NEW S3
STORAGE CLASS PURPOSE BUILT.
PURPOSE BUILT TO OFFER THE
HIGHEST PERFORMANCE AND LOWEST
LATENCY CLOUD OBJECT FOR STORAGE
YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY ACCESSED
DATA. S3 EXPRESS ONE ZONE USES
PURPOSE BUILT HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE TO ACCELERATE DATA
PROCESSING. IT ALSO GIVES YOU
THE OPTION TO ACTUALLY CHOOSE
YOUR AZ FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND
YOU CAN BRING YOUR FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED DATA NEXT TO YOUR HIGH
PERFORMANCE COMPUTE RESOURCE WIZ
TO MINIMIZE LATENCY. SO S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE SUPPORTS
MILLIONS OF REQUESTS PER MINUTE
WITH CONSISTENT SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. THE FASTEST
OBJECT STORAGE IN THE CLOUD AND
UP TO TEN TIMES FASTER THAN S3
STANDARD STORAGE. NOW THE FASTER
DATA PROCESSING LETS YOU SAVE UP
TO 60% ON YOUR COMPUTE COSTS AS
WELL. FOR WORKLOADS THAT REQUIRE
THE HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS
AND THE DATA ACCESS COSTS. ALSO
ARE 50% LOWER THAN S3 STANDARD.
SO YOU CAN RUN THESE WORKLOADS
AT MUCH, MUCH LOWER COST. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, WITH S3 EXPRESS, ONE
ZONE, PINTEREST HAS OBSERVED
OVER TEN TIMES FASTER RIDE
SPEEDS WHILE REDUCED THEIR TOTAL
COST BY 40% FOR ITS MACHINE
LEARNING POWERED VISUAL
INSPIRATION ENGINE. NOW THIS IS
ENABLING THEM TO DO FASTER
EXPERIMENTATION AND
PERSONALIZATION, IMPROVING
EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR USERS. SO
17 YEARS AGO, S3 REINVENTED
STORAGE BY LAUNCHING THE FIRST
CLOUD SERVICE FOR AWS AND WITH
S3 EXPRESS, ONE ZONE, YOU CAN
SEE S3 CONTINUING TO CHANGE HOW
DEVELOPERS USE STORAGE. THE SAME
SIMPLE INTERFACE AND SAME LOW
COST. AND NOW? NOW EVEN FASTER.
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
REINVENTION. GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING. SO WE REALIZED ALMOST
TEN YEARS AGO THAT IF WE WANTED
TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE
ON PRICE PERFORMANCE FOR ALL OF
YOUR WORKLOADS, WE HAD TO
REINVENT GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING FOR THE CLOUD ERA ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO THE SILICON AND
IN 2018, WE BECAME THE FIRST
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER TO DEVELOP
OUR OWN GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTE
PROCESSORS. WHEN WE ANNOUNCED
GRAVITON, OUR SERVER PROCESS OR
CHIP AND CUSTOMERS LOVE THE COST
SAVINGS THAT IT DELIVERED FOR
SCALE OUT WORKLOADS LIKE
MICROSERVICES AND WEB
APPLICATIONS, BUT ASKED FOR MORE
. SO WE BROUGHT YOU GRAVITON2,
WHICH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE SEVEN
FOLD FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF
WORKLOADS AND WE DIDN'T STOP
THERE. OUR CURRENT GENERATION.
GRAVITON THREE DELIVER IS UP TO
25. BETTER COMPUTE PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO GRAVITON2 AND THE
BEST PRICE PERFORMANCE IN EC2.
IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO USES 60%
LESS ENERGY FOR THE SAME LEVEL
OF PERFORMANCE AND THIS IS SO,
SO IMPORTANT TO SO MANY
CUSTOMERS TODAY. AND THAT'S
COMPARED TO COMPARABLE EC2
INSTANCES. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY
IS ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE
IMPORTANT. TODAY. WE'VE GOT OVER
150 GRAVITON BASED INSTANCES
ACROSS THE EC2 PORTFOLIO AND
MORE THAN 50,000 CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING ALL OF THE TOP 100 EC2
CUSTOMERS, USE GRAVITON BASED
INSTANCES TO REALIZE PRICE
PERFORMANCE BENEFITS. FOR
EXAMPLE, SAP, THEY'VE PARTNERED
WITH AWS TO ACTUALLY POWER SAP,
HANA CLOUD WITH GRAVITON AND
WITH GRAVITON. SAP HAS SEEN UP
TO 35% BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
FOR ANALYTICS WORKLOADS AND AIMS
TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT
. THEIR CARBON IMPACT BY AN
ESTIMATED 45. SUPER IMPRESSIVE
OF WE ARE RELENTLESS ABOUT
INNOVATION AND WE CONTINUE TO
PUSH THE ENVELOPE FURTHER. SO
TODAY I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THE LATEST GENERATION OF OUR
GRAVITON PROCESSOR AWS GRAVITON.
FOUR GRAVITON FOUR OR GRAVITON
FOUR IS THE MOST POWERFUL AND
THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT CHIP
THAT WE HAVE EVER BUILT, WITH
50% MORE CORES AND 75% MORE
MEMORY BANDWIDTH THAN GRAVITON.
THREE GRAVITON, FOUR CHIPS ARE
30% FASTER ON AVERAGE THAN
GRAVITON. THREE AND PERFORM EVEN
BETTER FOR CERTAIN WORKLOADS,
LIKE 40% FASTER FOR DATABASE
APPLICATIONS AND 45% FASTER FOR
JAVA APPLICATIONS AS WE WERE THE
FIRST TO DEVELOP AND OFFER OUR
OWN SERVER PROCESSORS, WE'RE NOW
IN OUR FOURTH GENERATION. IN
JUST FIVE YEARS. OTHER CLOUD
PROVIDERS HAVE NOT EVEN
DELIVERED ON THEIR FIRST SERVER
PROCESSORS YET. WE'RE ALSO
ANNOUNCING THE PREVIEW OF OUR
FIRST INSTANCE BASED ON GRAVITON
FOUR RAG INSTANCES AS RAG IS
PART OF OUR MEMORY OPTIMIZED
INSTANCE FAMILY. THEY'RE
DESIGNED TO DELIVER FAST, FAST
PERFORMANCE FOR WORKLOADS. THAT
PROCESS LARGE DATA SETS AND
MEMORY LIKE DATABASES OR REAL
TIME BIG DATA ANALYTICS. RAG
INSTANCES PROVIDE THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY
EFFICIENCY FOR MEMORY INTENSIVE
WORKLOADS AND THERE ARE MANY,
MANY MORE GRAVITON. FOUR
INSTANCES COMING HIGHLY RELIABLE
REGIONS WITH AVAILABILITY ZONES
DURABLE, INSTANTLY SCALABLE, LOW
COST STORAGE, LEADING PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITH CUSTOM DESIGNED
CHIPS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW
EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'RE
REINVENTING TO CONSTANTLY
DELIVER WHAT YOU NEED TO DRIVE
YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE, YOUR
INNOVATION, AND YOUR BUSINESSES.
AND FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES WE
HAVE BEEN SO INTENT ON PROVIDING
YOU WITH THE BROADEST AND
DEEPEST FUNCTIONALITY WITH THE
FAST PACE OF INNOVATION, THE
MOST RELIABLE, THE MOST SECURE
CLOUD SERVICES AND OF COURSE THE
LARGEST AND THE MOST DIVERSE
COMMUNITY OF CUSTOMERS AND
PARTNERS. NOW THESE ADVANTAGES
ARE ALWAYS RELEVANT, BUT NO MORE
SO THAN TODAY, BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALSO THE FOUNDATION FOR
REINVENTING WITH GENERATIVE AI I
NOW HERE TO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
THE BROADEST AND DEEPEST
CAPABILITIES, THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY AND
THE PRIVACY YOU TRUST. YOU NEED
AT ALL. AMAZON HAS BEEN
INNOVATING WITH AI FOR DECADES.
WE USE IT ACROSS THE COMPANY TO
OPTIMIZE THINGS LIKE OUR COMPANY
WIDE SUPPLY CHAIN TO CREATE
BETTER RETAIL SEARCH
CAPABILITIES, WIZ TO DELIVER NEW
EXPERIENCES LIKE AMAZON, ALEXA
OR OUR JUST WALK OUT SHOPPING
TECHNOLOGY. GENAI IS THE NEXT
STEP IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,
AND IT IS GOING TO REINVENT
EVERY APPLICATION THAT WE
INTERACT WITH AT WORK AND AT
HOME. WE'RE READY TO HELP YOU
REINVENT WITH GENERATIVE AI
BECAUSE AGAIN, WE THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES
TO MEET YOUR NEEDS AND WE
REINVENT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND
BECAUSE WE'RE INTIMATELY
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT MEANS TO
REINVENT OURSELVES AS WE
UNDERSTAND HOW TO HELP YOU WITH
YOUR REINVENTIONS. FROM STARTUPS
TO ENTERPRISES, ORGANIZATIONS OF
ALL SIZES ARE GETTING GOING WITH
GENERATIVE AI. THEY WANT TO TAKE
THE MOMENTUM THAT THEY'RE
BUILDING WITH EARLY
EXPERIMENTATION AND TURN IT INTO
REAL WORLD PRODUCTIVITY GAINS
AND INNOVATE, INNOVATE,
INNOVATE. SO WE THINK ABOUT
GENERATIVE AI AS HAVING ACTUALLY
THREE MACRO LAYERS, IF YOU WILL,
OF A STACK. AND THEY'RE ALL
EQUALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE ARE
INVESTING IN ALL THREE OF THEM.
SO THE BOTTOM LAYER IS USED TO
TRAIN FOUNDATION MODELS, OTHER
AND LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, FMS,
WE'LL CALL THEM AND TO RUN THESE
MODELS IN PRODUCTION, THE MIDDLE
LAYER PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE LMS
AND OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
YOU NEED AND ALL THE TOOLS THAT
YOU NEED TO BUILD AND SCALE
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
THEM. AND THEN AT THE TOP LAYER,
WE'VE GOT APPLICATIONS THAT ARE
BUILT USING FMS SO THAT YOU CAN
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GENERATIVE AI
QUICKLY WITHOUT EVEN NEEDING ANY
SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE. SO LET'S
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LAYER
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WITH, WITH,
WITH THE FOUNDATION MODELS,
THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF
WORKLOADS TRAINING AND INFERENCE
AND TRAINING IS TO CREATE AND
PROVE FMS BY LEARNING PATTERNS
FROM LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRAINING,
DATA AND INFERENCE. USE THAT TO
RUN THE MODELS IN PRODUCTION TO
GENERATE AN OUTPUT SUCH AS TEXT
OR IMAGES OR VIDEO. AND THESE
WORKLOADS CONSUME MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF COMPUTE POWER. SO TO
MAKE GENAI GENAI USE CASES
ECONOMICAL AND FEASIBLE, ALL YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR TRAINING, YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR INFERENCE ON
INCREDIBLY PERFORMANT, COST
EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR ML AND AI. NOW
GPUS ARE THE CHIPS THAT CAN
PERFORM A HIGH VOLUME OF
MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS,
SIMULTANEOUS ALI MAKING THEM
POPULAR FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT
WORKLOADS FROM ML SIMULATIONS,
3D RENDERING. AND WE'VE BEEN
COLLABORATING WITH NVIDIA FOR
OVER 13 YEARS TO BRING GPUS TO
THE CLOUD BUILT ON COMPUTE
INSTANCES THAT SUPPORT A WIDE
RANGE OF USE CASES, INCLUDING
GRAPH SIX GAMING HPC, MACHINE
LEARNING, AND NOW OF COURSE
DEMAND AND GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS. IN 2010, AWS WAS THE
FIRST TO BRING NVIDIA GPUS TO
THE CLOUD WITH KG ONE OR THE
CLUSTER GPU INSTANCE. THEN WE
WERE THE FIRST TO OFFER NVIDIA V
100 GPUS WITH OUR P THREE
INSTANCES AND THEN WE WERE AGAIN
THE FIRST TO OFFER THE A 100
TENSOR CORE GPUS WITH OUR P FOUR
INSTANCES IN PRODUCTION AND
EARLIER THIS YEAR, YES, WE WERE
THE FIRST MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER
TO BRING NVIDIA H100 GPUS TO
MARKET WITH OUR P FIVE INSTANCES
AND THE P FIVE ARE PROVIDING
AMAZING PERFORMANCE FOR
TRAINING. THEY'RE UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER AND 40% LESS
EXPENSIVE THAN P FOUR SECONDS.
NOW HAVING THE BEST CHIPS IS
GREAT AND NECESSARY, BUT TO
DELIVER THE NEXT LEVEL OF
PERFORMANCE, YOU NEED MORE THAN
JUST THE BEST GPUS. YOU ALSO
NEED REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE
CLUSTERS OF SERVERS THAT ARE
RUNNING THESE GPUS. OUR GPU
INSTANCES CAN BE DEPLOYED IN EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH UP TO 3200
GIGABITS PER SECOND OF
NETWORKING THROUGH OUR ELASTIC
FABRIC ADAPTER OR EFA. AND THIS
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
20,000 GPUS IN A SINGLE CLUSTER
FOR PROVIDING UP TO 20 EXAFLOPS
OF AGGREGATE COMPUTE COMPUTE
CAPACITY, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO
A SUPERCOMPUTER. AND ALL OF OUR
GPU INSTANCES THAT ARE RELEASED
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS ARE BASED
ON OUR BREAKTHROUGH NITRO
SYSTEM, WHICH REINVENT NOTED
VIRTUALIZATION BY OFFLOADING
STORAGE AND NETWORKING TO
SPECIALIZED CHIPS SO THAT ALL OF
THE SERVICE COMPUTE IS DEDICATED
TO RUNNING YOUR WORKLOADS. AND
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT OTHER
CLOUD PROVIDERS CAN OFFER. AGAIN
NOW WITH NITRO THIS DELIVERS
PERFORMANCE INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM BARE METAL, BUT AT A LOWER
PRICE. AND THE NITRO SYSTEM ALSO
PROVIDES ENHANCED SECURITY THAT
CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS AND
PROTECTS AND VERIFIES THAT THE
INSTANCE HARDWARE AND FIRMWARE
ARE ALL ROBUST. WE'VE WORKED
CLOSELY WITH NVIDIA TO INTEGRATE
OUR NETWORKING AND OUR
VIRTUALIZATION CAPABILITIES WITH
THEIR CHIPS TO BRING OUR GPU
INSTANCES TO CUSTOMERS AND TODAY
I'M THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE
ARE EXPANDING OUR PARTNERSHIP
WITH NVIDIA WITH MORE
INNOVATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO
DELIVER THE MOST ADVANCED
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS WITH, WITH WITH GPUS
AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE JENSEN
HUANG, FOUNDER AND CEO OF NVIDIA
HERE ON STAGE WITH US TO TELL US
MORE. KALLEL JENSEN, SO GOOD TO
SEE YOU. I'M THRILLED TO BE
HERE. YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US TODAY. IT'S
AMAZING. SO AS I'VE JUST
DISCUSSED, WE'VE GOT A LONG
PARTNERSHIP. AWS NVIDIA. I'VE
BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME
TOGETHER AND I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT HOW THE TEAMS ARE
COLLABORATING. YOU AND I WERE
TALKING ABOUT THAT BACKSTAGE.
THE COLLABORATION IS AMAZING.
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LOT OF
YEARS AND I'M JUST THRILLED TO
DEEPEN THE PARTNERSHIP. THANK
YOU. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. I'M
THRILLED TO BE HERE TO CELEBRATE
THE AMAZING WORK OF OUR TWO
TEAMS AND TO HELP ANNOUNCE OUR
BIG NEW PARTNERSHIP. YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR
A VERY LONG TIME. IN FACT, AWS
WAS THE WORLD'S FIRST CLOUD TO
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GPU
ACCELERATED COMPUTING. AND YOU
PUT THE WORLD'S FIRST GPUS IN
THE CLOUD A LONG TIME AGO. AND
SINCE THEN, THIS IS AN AMAZING
STATISTIC. SIX IN THE LAST
SEVERAL YEARS ALONE, JUST FOR
THE AMPERE AND HOPPER GENERATION
WE'VE PUT UP DEPLOYED BOYD TO
MILNE, XEON CPUS IN AWS THAT'S
THREE Z FLOPS. 3000 EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER HOURS MOST YEAH
EXACTLY. YEAH MOST NATIONS WILL
BE HAPPY WITH ONE EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER AND AWS HAS 3000
OF THEM AND WE ARE JUST JUST
GETTING STARTED. I'M DELIGHTED
TO SEE THAT WE ARE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE TODAY A DEPLOYMENT OF A
WHOLE NEW FAMILY OF GPUS, THE L4
, THE L4 IS AND THE BRAND NEW H
200, THE H 200. THIS IS REALLY
AMAZING THING. THE COMBINATION
BETWEEN THE BRAND NEW TENSOR LLM
OPTIMIZING COMPILERS FOR
GENERATIVE AI AND H 200 IMPROVES
THE THROUGHPUT OF IN INFERENCE
LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL INFERENCE
BY A FACTOR OF FOUR REDUCING THE
COST IN JUST ONE YEAR BY A
FACTOR OF FOUR. NOW OUR
COLLABORATION STARTS WITH, OF
COURSE GREAT GPUS AND WE'RE
RAMPING SO INCREDIBLY FAST EACH
QUARTER. WE'RE STANDING UP AND
DEPLOYING MORE THAN ONE SET OF
FLOPS. MORE FOR AN AWS ONE XEN
OF FLOPS MORE EACH QUARTER. IT'S
AN UNBELIEVABLE NUMBER AND ALL
OF THIS IS, OF COURSE, MADE
POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE
ACCELERATED COMPUTING LIBRARIES.
OUR TWO TEAMS STOOD UP A WHOLE
BUNCH OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT
WE'RE ALSO BRINGING OUR MOST
POPULAR LIBRARIES, THE NVIDIA,
AI STACK, OUR NEMO LLM LARGE
LANGUAGE MODEL FRAMEWORK. THE
RETRIEVER FOR INFERENCE MODEL
FOR RAGS, OUR BIO NEMO DIGITAL
BIOLOGY, LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
FOUNDATION MODELS. ISAAC SIM ON
OMNIVERSE FOR ROBOTICS. THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT AMAZON ROBOTICS
USES TO SIMULATE ITS ROBOTS AND
ITS INCREDIBLE WAREHOUSES THAT
YOU GUYS DO. JUST ALL OF THESE
STACKS, SOFTWARE STACKS AND
LIBRARIES WE'RE GOING TO
INTEGRATE INTO AWS. SO OUR TWO
TEAMS HAVE BEEN REALLY, REALLY
BUSY. BUSY INDEED. AND THAT WAS
A LOT OF THAT WAS A LOT OF
ZETAS. AND EVERYTHING. YEAH. SO
AS YOU SAID, THE COLLABORATION
IS GOING TO ENABLE DEVELOPERS TO
ACCESS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY AND
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED IT TO
INNOVATE WITH GENERATIVE AI. NOW
THE ONE OF THE BIG
ANNOUNCEMENTS, OF COURSE, IS
THAT AWS IS GOING TO BE THE
FIRST CLOUD PROVIDER TO BRING
THE LATEST NVIDIA 200
GRACE-HOPPER SUPER CHIPS WITH A
NEW MULTI-NODE NVLINK TO THE
CLOUD FIRST PLACE. AND MAYBE YOU
CAN TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT THAT AND WHAT MAKES THAT
COMPUTING PLATFORM SO POWERFUL
AND HOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER
TO INTRODUCE IT. WELL, WE'RE
BOTH REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT ARM
PROCESSORS AND THE REASON WHY
ARM IS SO INCREDIBLE IS BECAUSE
WE CAN WE CAN MOLD IT TO EXACTLY
THE TYPE OF COMPUTING NEEDS THAT
WE HAVE. IT'S INCREDIBLY LOW
ENERGY. IT'S INCREDIBLY COST
EFFECTIVE. AND SO GRACE-HOPPER,
WHICH IS GX 200, CONNECTS TWO
REVOLUTIONARY PROCESSORS
TOGETHER IN A REALLY UNIQUE WAY.
IT CONNECTS THEM TOGETHER USING
A CHIP TO CHIP INTERCONNECT
CALLED NVLINK AT ONE TERABYTE
BYTES PER SECOND, AND IT'S
CONNECTED IN A COHERENT WAY SO
THAT THE GPU CAN ACCESS ALL OF
THE CPU'S MEMORY. THE CPU CAN
ACCESS ALL OF THE GPU'S MEMORY
AND SO THE TWO OF THESE
PROCESSORS COULD WORK HAND IN
HAND IN A REALLY FAST WAY. THE
SECOND THING THAT WE DID WAS WE
INVENTED A NEW WAY OF EXTENDING
NVLINK TO A VERY LARGE DOMAIN.
SO NOW 32 GRACE HOPPERS COULD BE
CONNECTED BY A BRAND NEW NVLINK
SWITCH, AND THAT BECOMES ONE
UNIT. AND WITH THE NITRO AWS
NITRO THAT BECOMES BASICALLY ONE
GIANT VIRTUAL GPU INSTANCE. I
MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE
THIS. YOU'VE GOT 30 2H2
HUNDREDS. INCREDIBLE HORSEPOWER
IN ONE VIRTUAL INSTANCE BECAUSE
OF AWS NITRO. AND THEN WE
CONNECT IT WITH AWS, EFA YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY FAST NETWORKING ING
ALL OF THESE UNITS NOW CAN
CREATE INTO A ULTRA CLUSTER AND
AWS GLUE CLUSTER. SO I CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE ALL THIS COME
TOGETHER. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE COMBINATION.
I MEAN, HOW CUSTOMERS ARE GOING
TO USE THIS STUFF. ONE CAN ONLY
IMAGINE AND I KNOW THAT THE TH
TWO HUNDREDS ARE REALLY GOING TO
SUPERCHARGE WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE
DOING. IT'S GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE OF COURSE, IN EC2
INSTANCES COMING SOON. NOW IN
THE WORLD OF GENERATIVE AI, A
LOT OF COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO,
UH, TO ONBOARD AI INTO THEIR
BUSINESS AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE
THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT IT
EXTENDS TO THE SOFTWARE, THE
SERVICES AND ALL OF THE OTHER
WORKFLOWS THAT THEY HAVE. SO
THIS LEADS OF COURSE, TO THE
SECOND BIG ANNOUNCEMENT WE HAVE
TODAY. SO PARTNERING NVIDIA TO
BRING THE NVIDIA DGX CLOUD TO
AWS AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE DGX
CLOUD IS IMPORTANT PLATFORM FOR
CUSTOMERS. WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
DGX CLOUD IS NVIDIA'S AI
FACTORY. THIS IS HOW OUR
RESEARCHERS ADVANCE AI. WE USE
AI TO DO NEURAL GRAPHICS. THE
WAY WE DO COMPUTER GRAPHICS
TODAY IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT AI.
WE USE AI TO ADVANCE. WE USE OUR
AI FACTORIES TO ADVANCE OUR
DIGITAL BIOLOGY MODELS, OUR
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS USE IT FOR
ROBOTICS, FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS.
WE USE IT TO SIMULATE EARTH, TO
A DIGITAL TWIN OF THE EARTH, TO
PREDICT WEATHER AND CLIMATE. IT
AND SO THE CLOUD IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO US. WE'RE
INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BUILD THE
LARGEST AI FACTORY NVIDIA HAS
EVER BUILT. WE'RE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE INSIDE OUR COMPANY WE
CALL IT PROJECT CIBA CIBA. YOU
ALL PROBABLY KNOW SINCE YOU'RE
AT A CONFERENCE IS THE LARGEST,
MOST MAGNIFICENT TREE IN THE
AMAZON. WE CALL IT PROJECT CIBA.
CIBA IS GOING TO BE 16,000 AND
16,384 GPUS CONNECTED INTO ONE
GIANT AI SUPERCOMPUTER. FOR THIS
IS UTTERLY INCREDIBLE. WE WILL
BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE TRAINING
TIME OF THE LARGEST LANGUAGE
MODELS. THE NEXT GENERATION
MOISES THESE LARGE EXTREMELY
LARGE MIXTURE MIXTURE OF
EXPERTS, MODELS AND BE ABLE TO
TRAIN IT IN JUST HALF OF THE
TIME, ESSENTIALLY REDUCE THE
COST OF TRAINING IN JUST ONE
YEAR IN HALF. NOW WE'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO TRAIN MUCH, MUCH
LARGER MULTI-MODAL MO MODELS
THIS NEXT GENERATION, LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS, THESE 16,000
GPUS WILL BE 65 EXAFLOPS. IT'S
LIKE 65 EXASCALE SUPERCOMPUTERS
IN ONE. AND SO I CAN'T WAIT FOR
US TO STAND THIS UP. OUR AI
RESEARCHERS ARE CHOMPING AT THE
BIT. NOW, OF COURSE, THIS IS
ALSO A PLACE WHERE WE
COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS AND
CUSTOMERS WHO NEED TO BUILD
CUSTOM AI MODELS. YOU KNOW, IT'S
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO USE OFF THE
SHELF MODELS AND THERE'S BE A
WHOLE BUNCH OF OFF THE SHELF
MODELS IN PUBLIC CLOUDS. IT'S
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN A
SOFTWARE PLATFORM. COMPANIES,
SAAS COMPANIES, FOR EXAMPLE,
SALESFORCE THAT YOU MENTIONED
EARLIER, THEY'LL HAVE ALL KINDS
OF OFF THE SHELF COPILOTS AND
GENERATIVE AI MODELS. BUT A LOT
OF COMPANIES NEED TO BUILD THEIR
OWN PROPRIETARY MODELS. AND SO
WE SET UP THE AI FACTORY. SO
THAT WE COULD PARTNER WITH THEM
TO HELP THEM CREATE THEIR CUSTOM
AIS, AND NOW THEY'LL RUN ALL ON
AWS. WE'LL DEVELOP THE MODEL ON
AWS, COLLABORATE WITH OUR
CUSTOMERS ON AWS, CONNECT THEM
ALL TO YOUR SERVICES AND STORAGE
SERVICES, SECURITY SERVICES AND
ALL KINDS OF OTHER GENERATIVE AI
SERVICES AND THEN DEPLOY IT ALL
IN AWS. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO DO THIS VERY FIRST TIME
IN AWS. IT'S ALL AMAZING. I
MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING
AMAZING THINGS. WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD TO SEE US COME
TOGETHER EVEN MORE TIGHTLY. I
MEAN, IT'S JUST GOING TO BRING
INCREDIBLE BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS
WHO ARE REALLY GOING TO NEED IT.
WE APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION,
APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU AND
LOOK FORWARD TO A LOT MORE OF
THAT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU,
ADAM. THANK YOU. JENSEN. HAVE A
GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. IT'S BEEN
A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. WE REALLY
APPRECIATED IT. NOW LET'S TALK
ABOUT CAPACITY OR ACTUALLY
GETTING ACCESS TO ALL OF THAT
AMAZING COMPUTE. SO CUSTOMERS
WHO WANT TO BUILD AND TRAIN
MODELS OFTEN NEED LARGE AMOUNTS
OF RELIABLE CLUSTERED CAPACITY.
IT HAS TO BE TOGETHER OR IN
CLUSTERS, BUT THEY DON'T
NECESSARILY NEED THE SAME AMOUNT
OF IT ALL THE TIME.
FOR EXAMPLE, CUSTOMERS TRAINING A MODEL. I
MEAN, THEY MIGHT STOP TO
EVALUATE NEWS, USE NEW TRAINING
DATA OR MAKE OTHER CHANGES, AND
THEN THEY WANT TO DO MORE
TRAINING. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS
THAT THEY OFTEN NEED SHORT TERM
CLUSTERED CAPACITY AND IT'S
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NO ONE, NO
CLOUD HAS BEEN ADDRESSING UNTIL
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
FOR ML AND EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
WERE THE FIRST CONSUMPTION MODEL
IN THE INDUSTRY THAT ENABLES ANY
CUSTOMER TO RESERVE THE HIGHLY
SOUGHT AFTER GPU CAPACITY TO RUN
FOR SHORT DURATION MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS. AND THIS
ELIMINATES THE NEED TO HOLD ON
TO THE CAPACITY HOLDING CAPACITY
THAT THEY'RE USING JUST SO THEY
CAN BE CERTAIN THAT THEY CAN USE
IT LATER IF THEY NEED TO USE IT
LATER. NOW EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
ARE DEPLOYED IN ULTRACLUSTERS
INTERCONNECTED WITH OUR EFA
NETWORKING THAT WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THIS MORNING AND THAT
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
HUNDREDS OF GPUS IN A SINGLE
CLUSTER WITH THIS NEW OFFERING.
SO WITH THE CAPACITY BLOCKS,
CUSTOMERS CAN PLAN FOR THEIR ML
WORKLOAD DEPLOYMENTS WITH
CERTAINTY AND THEY KNOW THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE GPU
CAPACITY WHEN THEY NEED IT AND
ONLY WHEN THEY NEED IT. NOW
SUPPORT FOR THE LATEST
GENERATION. HIGH PERFORMANCE
GPUS COMBINED WITH OUR
INNOVATIONS, VIRTUALIZATION,
NETWORKING, CLUSTER MANAGEMENT.
THESE ARE REASONS WHY AWS IS THE
BEST PLACE TO RUN GPUS IN THE
WORLD, BUT TO DRIVE INNOVATION
AND THE BROAD CHOICES THAT OUR
CUSTOMERS WANT IN ML AND AI, WE
REALIZED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT
AGAIN HERE IS ANOTHER PLACE WE'D
HAVE TO INNOVATE ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO THE SILICON, JUST LIKE
WE DID WITH GRAVITON FOR GENERAL
PURPOSE COMPUTING AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT TRAINIUM AND INFERENTIA
. SO TRAINIUM IS OUR PURPOSE
BUILT CHIP FOR TRAINING, MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS, MACHINE
LEARNING MODELS AND INFERENTIA
IS OUR CHIP OPTIMIZED FOR
RUNNING INFERENCE ON THOSE
MODELS? SO EARLIER THIS YEAR WE
ALREADY ANNOUNCED THE SECOND
GENERATION OF OUR INFERENTIA
CHIP INFERENTIA TO AND BECAUSE
WE OPTIMIZE FOR INFERENCE, THE
TWO INSTANCES POWERED BY
INFERENTIA TO ARE OFFER THE BEST
LOWEST COST INFERENCE IN EC2
WHILE ALSO DELIVERING UP TO FOUR
TIMES HIGHER THROUGHPUT AND TEN
TIMES LOWER LATENCY COMPARED TO
THE INF1 INSTANCES. CUSTOMERS
LIKE ADOBE, DEUTSCHE TELEKOM,
LEONARDO, AI, THEY'VE ALL SEEN
GREAT EARLY RESULTS AND THEY ARE
DEPLOYING THEIR GENERATIVE AI AI
MODELS AT SCALE WITH INFERENTIA
TO. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF
INTEREST IN TRAINIUM AS WELL.
OUR TRN1 INSTANCES POWERED BY
TRAINIUM HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED BY A
LOT OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
ANTHROPIC PARTNERS LIKE
DATABRICKS AND RICOH AND OUR OWN
AMAZON SEARCH TEAM USES TRN1
INSTANCES TO TRAIN TRAIN A
LARGE, DEEP, LARGE SCALE, DEEP
LEARNING MODELS. THEY'RE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF A TRAINIUM HIGH
PERFORMANCE SCALE RELIABILITY
AND LOW COST. BUT AS CUSTOMERS
CONTINUE TO TRAIN BIGGER AND
BIGGER MODELS ON LARGER AND
LARGER DATA SETS, WE REALIZED WE
NEEDED TO KEEP PUSHING AND
PUSHING OUR PRICE PERFORMANCE.
WE'RE NEVER DONE THERE. AND
TODAY I'M REALLY EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE AWS TRAINIUM TO OUR
SECOND GENERATION. IT'S OUR
SECOND GENERATION CHIP. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR HIGH
PERFORMANCE TRAINING OF
FOUNDATION MODELS, TRAINING IS
DESIGNED TO DELIVER UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO OUR FIRST GENERATION
CHIPS AND THAT MAKES IT IDEAL
FOR TRAINING FOUNDATION MODELS
WITH HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OR
EVEN TRILLIONS OF PARAMETERS.
TRAINIUM TWO IS GOING TO POWER
THE NEXT GENERATION OF EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND WILL DELIVER
UP TO 65 EXAFLOPS OF AGGREGATE
COMPUTE AND WE EXPECT THE FIRST
TRAINIUM TWO BASED INSTANCES ARE
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR
AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO DO
WITH THEM. MEANWHILE ALL A LOT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS ARE
STILL JUST TALKING ABOUT THEIR
OWN. ML CHIPS. WE'VE ALSO MADE A
LOT OF EXCITING PROGRESS IN
BUILDING THE SOFTWARE TOOLCHAIN
THAT SUPPORTS TRAINIUM IN
INFERENTIA. SO AWS NEURON IS OUR
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT THAT
HELPS CUSTOMERS GET MAXIMUM
PERFORMANCE FROM ML CHIPS. NEW
RON SUPPORTS MACHINE LEARNING
FRAMEWORKS LIKE TENSORFLOW
PYTORCH WITH JAX SUPPORT COMING
REALLY SOON AND SO CUSTOMERS CAN
USE THEIR EXISTING KNOWLEDGE TO
BUILD TRAINING AND INFERENCE
PIPELINES WITH JUST A FEW LINES
OF CODE AND NEURON SUPPORTS THE
MOST POPULAR MODELS, INCLUDING
93 OF THE TOP 100 AND COUNTING.
IMPORTANTLY, YOU ALSO NEED THE
RIGHT TOOLS TO HELP TRAIN AND
DEPLOY YOUR MODELS AND THIS IS
WHY WE HAVE AMAZON SAGEMAKER OUR
MANAGED SERVICE. THAT MAKES IT
EASY FOR DEVELOPERS TO TRAIN,
TUNE, BUILD, MANAGE MACHINE
LEARNING AND FOUNDATION MODELS.
IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE WE
LAUNCHED SAGEMAKER, WE'VE
INTRODUCED A LOT OF POWERFUL
INNOVATIONS LIKE AUTOML MODEL
TUNING, DISTRIBUTED TRAINING,
FLEXIBLE MODEL DEPLOYMENT TOOLS
FOR ML OPS AND BUILT IN FEATURES
LIKE RESPONSIBLE AI. SAGEMAKER
HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN
DEMOCRATIZING ML FOR TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING STABILITY AI AI21LABS
LABS, THOMSON REUTERS,
ASTRAZENECA, 3M, HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AWS,
FERRARI AND MORE, AND SAGEMAKER
CAN TRAIN MODELS WITH UP TO
BILLIONS OF PARAMETERS FOR
EXAMPLE, TI HAS TRAINED 180
BILLION PARAMETER FALCON FM,
WHICH IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MODEL ON
SAGEMAKER USING 3000 GPUS AND
PETABYTES OF PETABYTES OF DATA
STORED IN S3. AND YOU CAN ALSO
DEPLOY THIS TOP RANKED MODEL
USING SAGEMAKER. WE'VE ALSO BEEN
WORKING CLOSELY WITH HUGGINGFACE
TO SUPPORT THEIR MODELS ON
SAGEMAKER AND HAVE COLLABORATED
TO CREATE THE HUGGING FACE DEEP
LEARNING CONTAINERS TO HELP
ACCELERATE TRAINING AND
DEPLOYMENT OF FMS USING
SAGEMAKER, TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA. SO IF YOU'RE
BUILDING YOUR OWN MODELS. AWS IS
RELENTLESSLY FOCUSED ON
EVERYTHING YOU NEED THE BEST
CHIPS, THE MOST ADVANCED
VIRTUALIZATION, POWERFUL
PETABYTE SCALE NETWORKING
CAPABILITIES, HYPER SCALE
CLUSTERING AND THE RIGHT TOOLS
TO HELP YOU BUILD. BUT OF
COURSE, AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF
ORGANIZATIONS JUST WANT TO BE
ABLE TO ACCESS THE MOST POWERFUL
MODELS OUT THERE. THEY WANT TO
GET STARTED QUICKLY,
EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT FMS
AND TESTING DIFFERENT USE CASES
AND TO MEET THE ENORMOUS
OPPORTUNITY HEAD ON. BUT THEY
ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH
MODEL SHOULD I EVEN USE AND HOW
DO I DECIDE WHICH ARE BEST FOR
MY APPLICATION? TITAN HOW CAN I
MOVE QUICKLY TO BUILD AND DEPLOY
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS? JENS
AND HOW CAN I KEEP MY DATA
SECURE AND PRIVATE? THAT'S WHY
WE'RE INVESTING IN THAT MIDDLE
LAYER OF THE STACK. SO NOW WE
KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU NEED IT TO
BE EASIER TO ACCESS A POWERFUL
AND DIVERSE SET OF MODELS. LMS
OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS, AND
THEN TO QUICKLY BUILD
APPLICATIONS WITH THEM ALL THE
TIME, MAINTAINING YOUR SECURITY
AND PRIVACY AND THAT'S WHY WE
BUILT AMAZON BEDROCK SO BEDROCK
IS THE EASIEST WAY TO BUILD AND
SCALE GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS
FOR LMS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS AND CUSTOMERS IN EVERY
INDUSTRY ARE ALREADY USING
BEDROCK TO REINVENT THEIR USER
EXPERIENCES, THEIR PRODUCTS AND
THEIR PROCESSES, AND TO BRING AI
INTO THE HEART OF THEIR
BUSINESSES. SO WHY BEDROCK? SO
FIRST, YOU ENJOY THE BROADEST
CHOICE OF MODELS, MANY OF WHICH
ARE AVAILABLE FIRST OR IN SOME
CASES ONLY ON BEDROCK YOU CAN
ADD YOUR OWN BUSINESS CONTEXT
QUICKLY, EASILY AND PRIVATELY
WITH THE BROADEST SELECTION OF
CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS AND YOU
GET ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
AND PRIVACY. BECAUSE WE DESIGNED
IT THAT WAY FROM DAY ONE. AND
THE CUSTOMER EXCITEMENT HAS BEEN
OVERWHELMING. WE MADE THE
SERVICE GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN
SEPTEMBER AND NOW OVER 10,000
CUSTOMERS ARE USING BEDROCK
AROUND THE WORLD ACROSS
VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY, ADIDAS
HAS ENABLING DEVELOPERS TO GET
QUICK, ACCURATE ANSWERS TO DEEP
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, AS CARRIER
IS USING BEDROCK TO COMBINE
HISTORICAL ACTIONS, PREDICTIVE
ANALYTICS SYSTEMS, ALERTS AND
DATA TRENDS TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THESE ARE
HELPING CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR
ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CUT
CARBON EMISSIONS. NASDAQ IS
USING BEDROCK TO AUTOMATE
INVESTIGATIVE WORKFLOWS ON
SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS AND TO
STRENGTHEN THEIR ANTI ANTI
FINANCIAL CRIME AND SURVEILLANCE
CAPABILITIES. SO MANY MORE,
INCLUDING BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES, CLARIANT COX
AUTOMOTIVE, GODADDY. LEXISNEXIS.
MERCK OMNICOM GROUP ARE ALL
USING BEDROCK. THEY'RE ALL USING
IT TO BUILD GENAI APPLICATIONS.
TODAY BUT IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS.
EVERY ONE IS MOVING FAST,
EXPERIMENTING AND LEARNING. AND
AT THE SAME TIME, THE GENERATIVE
AI TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IS EVOLVING
QUICKLY WITH NEW DEVELOPMENTS
PRACTICALLY EVERY DAY AND
CUSTOMERS ARE FINDING THAT
DIFFERENT MODELS ACTUALLY WORK
BETTER FOR DIFFERENT USE CASES
OR ON DIFFERENT SETS OF DATA.
SOME MODELS ARE GREAT FOR
SUMMARIZATION, OTHERS ARE GOOD
FOR REASONING AND INTEGRATION,
AND STILL OTHERS HAVE AWESOME
LANGUAGE SUPPORT. AND THEN
THERE'S IMAGE GENERATION IN
SEARCH USE CASES AND MORE, ALL
COMING FROM BOTH PROPRIETARY
MODELS AND MODELS THAT ARE
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY.
I MEAN, THINGS ARE MOVING SO
FAST AND IN THAT TYPE OF
ENVIRONMENT THAT THE ABILITY TO
ADAPT IS THE MOST VALUABLE
CAPABILITY THAT YOU CAN HAVE.
THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE
MODEL TO RULE THEM ALL, AND
THERE'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE ONE COMPANY PROVIDING THE
MODELS THAT EVERYBODY USES. SO
YOU DON'T WANT A CLOUD PROVIDER
WHO'S BEHOLDEN PRIMARILY TO ONE
MODEL PROVIDER. YOU NEED TO BE
TRYING OUT DIFFERENT MODELS. YOU
NEED TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH
BETWEEN THEM RAPIDLY OR EVEN
COMBINING THEM WITH THE SAME USE
CASES. AND YOU NEED A REAL
CHOICE OF MODEL PROVIDERS AS YOU
DECIDE WHO'S GOT THE BEST
TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO WHO HAS THE
DEPENDABILITY THAT YOU NEED IN A
BUSINESS PARTNER. I THINK THE
EVENTS OF THE PAST TEN DAYS HAVE
MADE THAT VERY CLEAR. WE'VE BEEN
CONSISTENT ABOUT THIS NEED FOR
CHOICE FOR THE WHOLE HISTORY OF
AWS, AND THAT'S THE APPROACH
THAT WE CLEARLY LAID OUT WHEN WE
STARTED TALKING ABOUT OUR
GENERATIVE AI STRATEGY ALMOST A
YEAR AGO. AND THAT'S WHY WE
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE, TO MAKE
BUILDING AND MOVING BETWEEN A
RANGE OF FOUNDATION MODELS AS
EASY AS AN API CALL. TODAY
BEDROCK PROVIDES ACCESS TO A
WIDE RANGE OF MODELS FROM
LEADERS LIKE I. 21 ANTHROPIC
COHERE STABILITY AI, AS WELL AS
AMAZON'S OWN AMAZON TITAN MODELS
. BUT WE DIDN'T STOP THERE. WE
WERE THE FIRST TO MAKE METIS
LLAMA 2 MODEL AVAILABLE THROUGH
A FULLY MANAGED API. AND WE ALSO
RECENTLY ANNOUNCED OUR EXPANDED
COLLABORATION WITH ANTHROPIC. SO
ANTHROPIC IS A LONG TIME AWS
CUSTOMER AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S
LEADING FOUNDATION MODEL
PROVIDERS. THEIR MODELS CLAUDE
AND THEY GOT OTHERS AS WELL
EXCEL AT A WIDE RANGE OF TASKS
FROM SOPHISTICATED DIALOG AND
CREATIVE CONTENT GENERATION TO
COMPLEX REASONING AND DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS. SO AS PART OF THE
COLLABORATION, ANTHROPIC IS
GOING TO USE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA TO TRAIN FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF THEIR MODELS AND
BEDROCK CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO
HAVE EARLY ACCESS, NOT AVAILABLE
ON OTHER CLOUDS TO UNIQUE
FEATURES FOR MODEL CUSTOMIZATION
AND FINE TUNING CAPABILITIES. SO
TO DIG IN ON WHAT WE'RE DOING
WITH ANTHROPIC, I'D LIKE TO
BRING OUT OUR PARTNER DARIO
OMODEI, WHO'S THE CEO AND
CO-FOUNDER OF ANTHROPIC. LET'S
GIVE HIM A HAND. AS WELL. ALL
RIGHT. WE HAVE CHAIRS. LET'S SIT
. DARIO THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. YEAH.
EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
CLAUDE IS AVAILABLE ON BEDROCK,
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT,
LET'S JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS ABOUT
AND WHAT MAKES CLAUDE SO UNIQUE.
YES SO ANTHROPIC WAS FOUNDED ON
THE IDEA THAT WE CAN MAKE AI
MODELS THAT ARE SAFE, RELIABLE
AND STEERABLE WHILE STILL BEING
HIGHLY CAPABLE. THE FOUNDERS OF
ANTHROPIC WERE A SET OF PEOPLE
WHO WORKED AT OPENAI FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. WE DEVELOPED IDEAS LIKE
GPT THREE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK, SCALING
LAWS FOR LANGUAGE MODELS. SOME
OF THE KEY IDEAS BEHIND THE
CURRENT GENERATIVE AI BOOM.
SEVEN OF US LEFT AND FOUNDED
ANTHROPIC, OUR FOUNDATION MODEL
CLAUDE. IN ADDITION TO BEING
SAFE AND RELIABLE, EXCELS AT A
LOT OF KNOWLEDGE WORK TASKS LIKE
CONTENT, GENERATION,
SUMMARIZATION, Q&A, COMPLEX
REASONING, THINGS LIKE THAT. WE
HAVE AN INDUSTRY LEADING CONTEXT
WINDOW OF 200 K TOKENS. THAT'S
ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH MAKES
IT WELL SUITED FOR AREAS LIKE
LEGAL FINANCE, INSURANCE,
CODING, THINGS LIKE THAT. AND
ABOUT HALF OF THE FORTUNE 500
ARE USING OR ARE TESTING CLAUDE.
SO AMAZING PROGRESS. SO JUST A
FEW MONTHS AGO, OBVIOUSLY AMAZON
AND ANTHROPIC ANNOUNCED KIND OF
AN ENHANCED STRATEGIC
COLLABORATION ANTHROPIC NAMED
AWS IS YOUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO
BE TRAINING AND DEPLOYING FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF CLAUDE AND
FOUNDATION MODELS ON AWS. SO
JUST TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT LED
UP TO THIS AND HOW THAT
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANTHROPIC
AND AWS GROW? YEAH. SO ANTHROPIC
USE OF AWS GOES BACK TO OUR
EARLY HISTORY BACK ALL THE WAY
IN THE MIDST OF TIME IN 2021. WE
CAN REMEMBER THAT, RIGHT? WE
TRAINED OUR FIRST. WE TRAINED
OUR FIRST MODEL ON AWS. AND SO
WE'RE EXCITED NOW TO SAY THAT
YOU GUYS ARE OUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS. I WOULD SAY THE
PARTNERSHIP HAS THREE
COMPONENTS. FIRST IS THE COMPUTE
SIDE, WHICH I JUST DISCUSSED,
WHICH WE'VE BEEN DOING
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY. THE SECOND IS ON THE
PROVISION TO CUSTOMER SIDE.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT
AMAZON BEDROCK WE REALLY
RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THAT WE
COULD PROVIDE TO CUSTOMERS
WORKING TOGETHER AND THE THIRD
SIDE IS THE HARDWARE. WE'RE
CURRENTLY WORKING WITH YOU GUYS
TO OPTIMIZE THESE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA FOR OUR USE CASES AND
HOPEFULLY FOR OTHER USE CASES.
AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE
CAN ACHIEVE THAT FOREX FASTER
THAN THE FIRST GENERATION
TRAINIUM THAT YOU JUST
ANNOUNCED. IF WE OPTIMIZE THESE
THINGS TOGETHER. AND SO PUTTING
TOGETHER THESE THREE PIECES,
LAYERS OF THE STACK REALLY
ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE THINGS TO
CUSTOMERS TOGETHER THAT COULDN'T
BE PROVIDED BEFORE THINGS LIKE
CUSTOMIZATION OF MODELS USE OF
PROPRIETARY DATA AND UNIQUE FINE
TUNING FEATURES. WELL, IT'S THE
RESPECT WE HAVE FOR YOU GUYS IS
JUST TREMENDOUS. I MEAN, TRULY
WORLD CLASS EXPERTISE FOR THE
ANTHROPIC TEAM. I'VE REALLY
ENJOYED WORKING TOGETHER AND THE
MODELS ARE JUST SO POWERFUL. SO
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE AIMING TO AND I
THINK WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
IMPROVING AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES THROUGH
THIS COLLABORATION. TITAN AND OF
COURSE OUR OWN AMAZON DEVELOPERS
ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO ANTHROPIC
MODELS ON BEDROCK AND THROUGHOUT
THE COMPANY. AND WE'RE NOT ONLY
WORKING TO PROVIDE HOOD
CUSTOMERS WITH, WITH, WITH THIS,
BUT WE'RE GIVING THEM EARLY
ACCESS TO UNIQUE FEATURES THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
GET ANYWHERE ELSE. AND WE'RE OUT
THERE TOGETHER WITH OUR
GENERATIVE AI INNOVATION CENTER,
WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE
FIELD, HELPING THEM TO ACTUALLY
GET GET TARGETED. AND THAT'S
ALLOWING US, OF COURSE, TO BRING
THIS EXPERTISE AND THE DOMAIN
SPECIFIC EXPERTISE THAT THEY
NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS.
AND AS WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE
TOGETHER AND IT'S BEEN HOT AND
HEAVY, PARTICULARLY THE PAST FEW
WEEKS, BUT BEFORE THAT AS WELL,
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST
INTERESTING USE CASES THAT
YOU'VE SEEN? YEAH SO I'LL GIVE
THREE EXAMPLES ACROSS DIFFERENT
INDUSTRIES. THERE'S MANY OTHERS,
BUT THIS SHOULD GIVE GIVE A
SENSE OF THE RANGE. AND WE WE'VE
SEEN A LOT OF ORGANIC ADOPTION.
ONE EXAMPLE IN THE BIOMEDICAL
SPACE WE'RE HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE
WE'RE WORKING WITH PFIZER. I'M A
FORMER BIOLOGIST MYSELF, SO I'M
REALLY EXCITED FOR ANY WAY I CAN
CAN ADVANCE MEDICAL SCIENCE AND
BRING BRING LIFE SAVING DRUGS TO
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND THE
LEGAL SPACE. WE MADE A CUSTOM
FINE TUNED MODEL, DEPLOYED IT TO
YOU GUYS FOR LEXISNEXIS TO HELP
WITH THEIR LEGAL SEARCH. YOU
KNOW, IN A WAY THAT'S KIND OF
FACT BASED AND PRODUCE CITATIONS
. AND IN THE FINANCE SPACE,
WE'RE WORKING WITH BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES TO DEVELOP AN
INVESTMENT ANALYST, ASSISTANT.
BUT BEYOND THAT, JUST SOME
EXAMPLES. WE'VE ENGAGED WITH
SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF SOME OF THE
LARGEST PLAYERS IN THE INSURANCE
AND BANKING INDUSTRIES AND, YOU
KNOW, COULD TELL SIMILAR STORIES
ABOUT OTHER INDUSTRIES. SO, YOU
KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE
NEW USE CASES AND WHERE ALL OF
THIS GOES. THAT'S INCREDIBLE
MOMENTUM. JUST THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES EXAMPLE TO BE WORKING
WITH WITH THAT MANY LEADERS. SO
JUST LAST WEEK YOU'RE NOT
STANDING STILL, RIGHT. SO JUST
LAST WEEK YOU ANNOUNCED CLAUDE
2.1. SO THAT'S GOT A WHOLE LOT
OF NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN KEY
CAPABLE CITIES. MAYBE YOU CAN
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.
YEAH. SO CLAUDE 2.1 REALLY IS A
RELEASE THAT'S TARGETED AT
ENTERPRISES. SO A FEW DIFFERENT
FEATURES. ONE IS WE'VE DOUBLED
OUR CONTEXT WINDOW TO 200,000
TOKENS. TOKENS IS A TERM OF ART
IN THE AI SPACE. WHAT IT AMOUNTS
TO IS ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH
IS A RELATIVELY LONG BOOK. AND
SO USE CASES LIKE READING
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, READING AN
ENTIRE LONG BOOK. AND ONE OF MY
FAVORITES, PUTTING MULTIPLE
DOCUMENTS IN THE CONTEXT WINDOW
AND ASKING THE MODEL TO COMPARE
THEM OR INTEGRATE THEM. A SECOND
FEATURE IS THAT WE'VE REDUCED
THE RATE OF SO-CALLED
HALLUCINATIONS, WHICH IS WHEN
MODELS SAY THINGS THAT AREN'T
TRUE TO BY BY ABOUT TWO X WE'VE
SEEN ACROSS THE INDUSTRY A CORE
OBSTACLE TO DEPLOYMENT IN THE
ENTERPRISE WORLD IS PEOPLE ARE
WORRIED THAT MODELS WILL SAY
THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE. NO ONE
HAS PERFECTLY SOLVED THIS
PROBLEM, BUT WE ARE REALLY
LEADING THE WAY IN GETTING MORE
AND MORE REDUCTIONS AND THEN WE
ALSO HAVE SOME BETA FEATURES AS
WE'RE INTRODUCING SYSTEM PROMPTS
FOR TOOL USE AS A BETA FEATURE
AND A DEVELOPER WORKBENCH.
AGAIN, ALL TOOLS TARGETED AT
PEOPLE BUILDING FOR ENTERPRISES.
WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE ALL THE USE
CASES THAT EMERGE FROM THIS. I'M
SPEECHLESS. YES, THAT IS SUCH
INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. YES. I
MEAN, YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU
TALKED ABOUT THE REDUCTION OF
HALLUCINATION, A REALLY
IMPORTANT TOPIC. YOU JUST MORE
BROADLY, I THINK WE SHARE A
BELIEF THAT I SHOULD BE SAFE,
SECURE, RESPONSIBLE AND BENEFIT
SOCIETY. AND WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED
A LOT OF GROUPS AND
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROMOTING
THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT
OF RESPONSIBLE AI IN FACT, I
KEEP BUMPING INTO DARIA AROUND
THE WORLD AT SOME OF THESE
VARIOUS GATHERINGS, WHICH IS
NICE. SO I KNOW THIS IS A
PARTICULAR PASSION OF YOURS. AND
CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT ANTHROPIC WORK IN
THIS AREA? YEAH I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING WE
WERE FOUNDED ON AND THAT WE CARE
ABOUT DEEPLY. WE I WOULD
CATEGORIZE IT INTO TWO AREAS
WHERE WE'VE DONE WORK IN THIS
AREA. ONE IS THE WAY WE DESIGN
OUR OWN MODELS AND THE OTHER IS
THE WAY THAT WE TRY TO SET AN
EXAMPLE FOR THE ECOSYSTEM AND
BRING OTHERS ALONG SO THAT
ULTIMATELY EVERYONE BECOMES
SAFER AND MORE RELIABLE. SO
LARGE FRACTION ON THE FIRST ONE,
A LARGE FRACTION OF OUR RESEARCH
ORG WORKS ON SAFETY. WE PUT A
LOT OF WORK INTO MAKING OUR
MODELS HARD TO BREAK, MAKING
THEM SECURE AGAINST MISUSE AND
HARMFUL USE. THERE WAS A RECENT
STUDY OUT OF CARNEGIE MELLON
WHERE PEOPLE TRIED TO
ADVERSARIALLY BREAK DIFFERENT
MODELS AND IT FOUND THAT THEY
WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY BREAK
CLAUDE TEN TIMES LESS OFTEN THAN
THEY WERE ABLE TO BREAK THE
COMPETITOR'S MODEL. SO THERE'S A
REAL DIFFERENCE HERE. A SECOND
WE'VE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO
INTERPRETABILITY SEEING INSIDE
THE MODELS. THERE'S NO
COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENTS ON THAT
SO FAR. BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG ARC
AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT RELATIVELY
SOON FOR BOTH COMPLIANCE AND FOR
UNDERSTANDING WHAT MODELS DO AND
THEREFORE REDUCING BAD BEHAVIOR
FROM THE MODELS, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE
WIDER ECOSYSTEM. YOU KNOW, WE
ALWAYS TRY TO CREATE A RACE TO
THE TOP, DO SOMETHING, AND THEN
COMPETITORS, OTHER PLAYERS IN
THE ECOSYSTEM, FOLLOW ALONG AND
DO THE SAME THING. AN EXAMPLE OF
THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE SCALING
POLICY WHERE WE FRONT LOADED
SAFETY INVESTMENT AHEAD OF MODEL
SCALING, A KIND OF
PRE-DEPLOYMENT TESTING REGIME
LIKE WHAT'S DONE FOR CARS AND
AIRPLANES. AND IN THE POLICY
SPACE, WE'VE CONTINUALLY
ADVOCATED FOR GOVERNMENTS TO
BUILD UP THEIR ABILITY TO
EVALUATE AND MEASURE AI SYSTEMS
AS IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO EVALUATE
AND MEASURE THINGS, WE'LL GET
EITHER NO REGULATION OR POORLY
INFORMED REGULATION. WE NEED TO
ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE CAN DEVELOP QUICKLY,
RESPONSIBLY, BUT IN A WAY THAT'S
SECURE. I JUST LOVE THE CONCEPT
OF THE RACE TO THE TOP. IT'S SO
POSITIVE. AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS SO AMAZING. I MEAN, WE'VE
SAID IT THE WHOLE 17 YEARS THAT
AWS HAS BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES
THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT GIVES US
ENERGY IS JUST WORKING WITH THE
COOLEST, MOST CUTTING EDGE, YOU
KNOW, STARTUPS AND ENTREPRENEURS
IN THE WORLD. AND THERE IS JUST
NO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN GENERATIVE AI NOW.
AND WHAT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS
DOING. SO IT'S GREAT TO BE
PARTNERING TOGETHER SO DEEPLY
AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
JOINING ME HERE ON STAGE TODAY.
YEAH, EXCITED FOR EVERYTHING WE
CAN DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU. ALL
RIGHT.
ALL RIGHTY. SO THAT'S AMAZING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN, DARIA,
FOR COMING OUT AND JOINING US.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. SO THE
INNOVATION AROUND GENERATIVE AI
MODELS IS EXPLOSIVE AND WE
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
WITH ALL OF OUR BEDROCK PARTNERS
FOR YEARS TO COME. INCREDIBLY
INNOVATIVE SPACE. AND WE'RE ALSO
EXCITED ABOUT THE LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS THAT WE'RE BUILDING
OURSELVES AT AMAZON SO OUR
AMAZON TITAN MODELS WERE CREATED
AND PRE-TRAINED BY AWS, AND
WE'RE BUILDING OUR OWN MODELS IN
ORDER TO BRING ACTUALLY A FEW
BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS. SO WE DO
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE HERE. I
MEAN, AMAZON HAS BEEN WORKING ON
AI FOR 25 YEARS. I'VE GOT A LONG
TRACK RECORD. WE USE THE
TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR BUSINESS
AND WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
BUILDING AND DEPLOYING MODELS.
AND AS A RESULT, WE CAN PROVIDE
A WHOLE RANGE OF MODELS THAT
OFFER REALLY POWERFUL
CAPABILITIES AND ALSO GREAT
ECONOMICS TO SUPPORT A WHOLE
BUNCH OF USE CASES AND WE
CAREFULLY CHOOSE HOW WE TRAIN
OUR MODELS AND THE DATA THAT WE
USE TO DO SO. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY
GOING TO INDEMNIFY CUSTOMERS
AGAINST CLAIMS THAT OUR MODELS
OR THEIR OUTPUTS INFRINGE ON
ANYBODY'S COPYRIGHT. NOW, THERE
ARE ALREADY MULTIPLE MODELS IN
THE TITAN FAMILY. WE'VE GOT
TITAN TEXT LITE, WHICH IS IDEAL
FOR TEXT BASED TASKS LIKE
SUMMARIZATION. WE'VE ALSO GOT
TITAN TEXT EXPRESS, WHICH IS
GREAT FOR MORE ADVANCED GENERAL
LANGUAGE TASKS LIKE COPY
EDITING, COPYWRITING AND WE'VE
ALSO GOT THE TITAN TEXT
EMBEDDINGS MODEL FOR SEARCH USE
CASES OR PERSONALIZATION AND
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ADDING
MODELS TO THE TITAN FAMILY. AND
IF YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT, THEN
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TUNE INTO
SWAMI'S KEYNOTE TOMORROW. A
LITTLE, LITTLE WORD UP NOW, ALL
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE
ALL EXTREMELY CAPABLE AND THEY
ALL ENABLE A LOT OF GREAT
APPLICATIONS. BUT TO REALLY
DRIVE YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED
GENERATIVE AI THAT UNDERSTANDS
YOUR BUSINESS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
CUSTOMERS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
PRODUCTS, YOUR OPERATIONS. AND
THAT'S ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN YOU
USE YOUR OWN DATA TO IMPROVE AND
CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS. THE MODELS
HAVE TO BECOME UNIQUE TO YOU. SO
AMAZON BEDROCK IS GIVING YOU ALL
OF THE PURPOSE BUILT
CAPABILITIES THAT YOU NEED TO
CUSTOMIZE THE AI APPLICATIONS
WITH YOUR OWN DATA. SO WITH A
FEW CLICKS YOU CAN GO FROM
GENERIC APPLICATIONS TO ONES
THAT ARE HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND
HIGHLY TAILORED. SO ONE
IMPORTANT TECHNIQUE IS CALLED
FINE TUNING. NOW, WITH FINE
TUNING, YOU POINT THE MODELS TO
EXAMPLES OF DATA IN S3 THAT
YOU'VE LABELED LABELED TO
PROVIDE CONTEXT. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU MIGHT POINT TO PROPOSALS AND
YOU'VE LABELED SOME OF THOSE
PROPOSALS AS STRONG. SO IN THIS
WAY THE MODEL LEARNS FROM YOU,
LEARNS FROM YOUR DATA. WHAT
MATTERS THE MOST TO YOU. AND
THEN BEDROCK MAKES A COPY OF THE
BASE MODELS. IT TRAINS IT, IT
CREATES A PRIVATE FINE TUNED
MODEL SO YOU GET TAILORED
RESPONSES. SO FINE TUNING IS
AVAILABLE IN AMAZON TITAN TEXT
LITE AND EXPRESS, AND TODAY IT'S
ALSO GENERALLY AVAILABLE FOR
COHERE COMMAND LITE AND META
LLAMA 2 AND FINE TUNING IS
COMING TO ANTHROPIC CLAUDE SOON.
SO A SECOND TECHNIQUE FOR
TAILORING TAILORING FOUNDATION
MODELS FOR YOUR BUSINESS IS
CALLED RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED
GENERATION OR RAG ANOTHER ONE OF
THE TERMS YOU SEE OUT THERE A
LOT. SO RAG ALLOWS YOU TO
CUSTOMIZE A MODEL'S RESPONSES
WHEN YOU WANT THE MODEL TO
CONSIDER NEW KNOWLEDGE OR UP TO
DATE INFORMATION. SO BEDROCK
DOES THIS FOR YOU BY CALLING AND
BRINGING BACK YOUR OWN DATA,
YOUR DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES,
INCLUDING DOCUMENT REPOSITORIES,
DATABASES AND OTHER APIS AND
MORE SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MODEL
MIGHT USE RAG TO RETRIEVE SEARCH
RESULTS FROM OUR AMAZON
OPENSEARCH SERVICE OR DOCUMENTS
FROM S3. AND IN SEPTEMBER, WE
INTRODUCED A RAG CAPABILITY
CALLED KNOWLEDGE BASES THAT
CONNECTS FM TO YOUR PROPRIETARY
DATA SOURCES TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR
PROMPTS WITH MORE INFORMATION
AND TODAY KNOWLEDGE BASES IS
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NOW, A
THIRD WAY THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE
MODELS INSIDE OF BEDROCK IS A
TECHNIQUE CALLED CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING. SO CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT
USES LARGE AMOUNTS OF UNLABELED
DATA BEFORE YOU FINE TUNE IT.
YOU DID THE LABELED DATA HERE IS
UNLABELED DATA LIKE THE RAW TEXT
OF INTERNAL REPORTS, FINANCIAL
PLANS OR RESEARCH RESULTS THAT
YOU HAVE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE
USED TO IMPROVE THE MODELS,
KNOWLEDGE AND ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES USING THINGS IN
YOUR OWN SPECIFIC DOMAIN. SO
CONTINUED PRE-TRAINING IS OF
COURSE AVAILABLE IN BEDROCK
TODAY. NOW ALL OF THESE
TECHNIQUES, THEY'RE ALL POWERFUL
TOOLS IN MAKING GENERATIVE AI
TARGETED, MAKING IT TRULY USEFUL
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND BEDROCK
MAKES IT REALLY EASY TO COMBINE
THESE TECHNIQUES TOGETHER. SO A
GREAT EXAMPLE OF A CUSTOMER
USING BEDROCK TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR
GENERATIVE AI AI APPLICATIONS IS
DELTA AIRLINES. SO DELTA IS
ACTUALLY MODERNIZING ITS
CUSTOMER SERVICE CAPABILITY WITH
GENERATIVE AI AI BUILT ON AMAZON
BEDROCK. THE NEW TOOL IS GOING
TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS IN A MORE RELEVANT AND
CONVERSATIONAL STYLE BY
ACCESSING DELTA'S TRAVEL
POLICIES, REAL TIME FLIGHT
SCHEDULES, CUSTOMER REBOOKING
OPTIONS AND AIRPORT CONDITIONS.
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD
RESPOND TO SIMPLE QUESTIONS LIKE
HOW MANY BAGS CAN I CHECK ON A
DELTA FLIGHT? AND IT CAN ALSO DO
MORE COMPLEX QUESTIONS LIKE CAN
I CARRY MY CAT WITH ME IN THE
CABIN TO JAMAICA? OF COURSE.
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH YOUR CAT?
DELTA'S BEEN
TESTING WITH DIFFERENT
FOUNDATION MODELS IN BEDROCK,
INCLUDING ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 2.0
CLAUDE INSTANT AND A FINE TUNED
AMAZON TITAN TEXT EXPRESS MODEL.
AND THIS WAY THEY CAN USE THE
RIGHT MODEL TO ANSWER DIFFERENT
CUSTOMER QUESTIONS IN. IT'S A
REALLY POWERFUL HOW THEY CAN
COMBINE THE MOST RELEVANT
INFORMATION NEEDED TO ANSWER ANY
SPECIFIC QUESTION. NOW, WITH THE
NEW CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOL
DELTA AIRLINES IS AIMING TO
PROVIDE A DELIGHTFUL AND
CONVERSATIONAL SELF-SERVICE
EXPERIENCE AND IT'S GOING TO
IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SO
EVERYONE WANTS MORE RELEVANT
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS,
RIGHT? AND BEDROCK IS MAKING IT
A LOT EASIER TO CUSTOMIZE THOSE
APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR OWN DATA.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU
WANT FMS TO DO MORE THAN JUST
PROVIDE USEFUL AND TARGETED
INFORMATION AND ULTIMATELY WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT IS TO USE
FMS TO TAKE ACTION TO ACTUALLY
GET THINGS DONE AND WE WANTED
YOU TO BE ABLE TO USE BEDROCK TO
COMPLETE ACTIONS LIKE BOOKING
TRAVEL, FILING INSURANCE CLAIMS,
DEPLOYING SOFTWARE, MAYBE
ORDERING REPLACEMENT PARTS. AND
THIS USUALLY REQUIRES
ORCHESTRATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE
SYSTEMS THAT OPERATE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S WHY A
FEW MONTHS AGO, WE INTRODUCED
AGENTS FOR BEDROCK. AND TODAY
I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS
POWERFUL FEATURE IS TODAY.
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. NOW WITH
AGENTS GENAI APPLICATIONS CAN
EXECUTE MULTI-STEP TASKS ACROSS
COMPANY SYSTEMS AND DATA SOURCES
FROM ANSWERING CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS ABOUT PRODUCT
AVAILABLE IOT TO TAKING A SALES
ORDER AND MORE AND BUILDING WITH
AGENTS IS REALLY EASY. FIRST,
YOU USE BEDROCK SETUP WIZARD TO
SELECT THE APPROPRIATE MODEL.
THEN YOU GIVE THE MODEL BASIC
INSTRUCTIONS TO HELP THE MODEL
UNDERSTAND HOW TO RESPOND. LIKE
YOU ARE A FRIENDLY CUSTOMER
SERVICE AGENT WHO HELPS
CUSTOMERS RETURN ITEMS. NEXT,
YOU SPECIFY THE LAMBDA FUNCTIONS
THAT EXECUTE THE API CALLS TO
RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION THAT'S
RELEVANT TO THE TASK. FOR
EXAMPLE, RETURN POLICIES OR
INVENTORY LEVELS. AND FINALLY,
YOU SELECT THE DATA SOURCES.
THEN YOU JUST SELECT, CREATE
AGENT AND BEDROCK, CONFIGURES
YOUR AGENT AND IT IS NOW READY
TO RUN WHEN THE AGENT RECEIVES A
REQUEST, IT USES ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES TO ANALYZE AND TO
PLAN THE TASK. AND THE MODEL
WORKS OUT THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS.
THE INFORMATION NEEDED, THE APIS
TO CALL AND WHEN TO CALL THEM.
THEN IT EXECUTE BETZ THE PLAN,
TAKING ALL THE STEPS THAT IT
NEEDS TO GATHER THE INFORMATION
AND THEN COMPLETE THE TASK. ALL
IN THE BACKGROUND. NO NEED TO
ENGINEER PROMPT, NO NEED TO
TRAIN THE FMS. NO NEED TO
MANUALLY CONNECT SYSTEMS WITH
AGENTS. GENERATIVE AI IS
BECOMING AN INTEGRAL PART OF
YOUR BUSINESS. MAKING IT EASY TO
TAKE ACTIONS AND GET TASKS DONE.
NO HEAVY LIFTING REQUIRED SO
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW BEDROCK
IS MAKING IT EASY TO CHOOSE
AMONGST LEADING MODELS AND ALSO
HOW IT GIVES YOU SO MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA AND HOW IT CAN
HELP COMBINE THE POWER OF MODELS
INTO YOUR ORGANIZATION'S
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA'S AND YOUR
API TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION. BUT
YOU WON'T ACTUALLY USE ANY OF
THIS IN A SERIOUS WAY IF IT
ISN'T SECURE AND PRIVATE.
I MEAN, YOU DEMAND THE
SAME ROCK SOLID RELIABILITY. THE
SAME SECURITY FOR GENERATIVE AI
THAT YOU DO FOR ANY WORKLOAD,
AND YOU REALLY NEED THIS TO HAVE
NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS
THAN EVERYTHING YOU EXPECT FROM
AN AWS SERVICE. IT'S JUST LIKE
S3. EC2. RDS. BEDROCK HAS GOT TO
HAVE ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
FEATURES TO MAKE YOUR DATA SAFE
AND PRIVATE, AND THAT'S WHAT IT
HAS. BEDROCK CUSTOMERS CAN TRUST
THAT THEIR DATA REMAINS
PROTECTED. NO CUSTOMER DATA IS
GOING TO BE USED TO TRAIN OR
IMPROVE THE ORIGINAL BASE
MODELS. WHEN YOU TUNE A MODEL,
WE MAKE A PRIVATE COPY OF THAT
MODEL. WE PUT IT IN A SECURE
CONTAINER AND IT GOES NOWHERE.
YOUR DATA IS NEVER EXPOSED TO
THE PUBLIC INTERNET, NEVER
LEAVES THE AWS NETWORK. IT'S
SECURELY TRANSFERRED THROUGH
YOUR VPC. IT'S ENCRYPTED IN
TRANSIT AND AT REST AND BEDROCK
ENFORCES THE SAME AWS ACCESS
CONTROLS YOU HAVE WITH ANY OF
OUR OTHER SERVICES AS BEDROCK
ALSO SUPPORTS A VARIETY OF
REGULATORY STANDARDS. IT'S HIPAA
ELIGIBLE. IT CAN BE USED IN
COMPLIANCE WITH GDPR. WE'VE
ADDED A BUNCH OF OTHER SECURITY
AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITIES,
INCLUDING INTEGRATIONS WITH
CLOUDWATCH TO TRACK USAGE AND
METRICS. CLOUDTRAIL TO MONITOR
API ACTIVITY AND TROUBLESHOOT
ACTIVITY. AND TODAY BEDROCK IS
SOC COMPLIANT. NOW THIS HELPS A
CUSTOMER ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS
CAN HAVE STRONG CONTROLS AND
POLICIES IN PLACE AND HELPS IT
BE USED IN EVERY BUSINESS. NOW,
BEYOND SECURITY, WE NEED
GENERATIVE AI TO BE DEPLOYED IN
A SAFE, TRUSTWORTHY AND RESPONSE
ABLE FASHION. LIKE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND
THAT'S OUR NORTH STAR FOR THE
CAPABILITIES THAT MAKE GENAI
SUCH A PROMISING TOOL FOR
INNOVATION. ALSO, DO INCREASE
THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE. WE'VE
GOT TO FIND WAYS TO UNLOCK
GENERATIVE AI AI'S FULL
POTENTIAL WHILE MITIGATING THE
RISKS. NOW, DEALING WITH THIS
CHALLENGE IS GOING TO REQUIRE
UNPRECEDENTED COLLABORATION AND
A TRULY MULTI-STAKEHOLDER EFFORT
ACROSS TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES,
POLICY MAKERS, COMMUNITY GROUPS,
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES AND
ACADEMICS. WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATING IN A LOT OF THE
GROUPS THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER
TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES EARLIER
THIS YEAR, I JOINED PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS
LIKE DARIO AS HE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'VE MADE A SERIES OF VOLUNTARY
COMMITMENTS TO PROMOTING THE
SAFE, THE SECURE AND THE
TRANSPARENT DEVELOPMENT OF AI
TECHNOLOGY. AND JUST THIS MONTH,
I JOINED A UK PRIME MINISTER
SUNAK, FOR HIS AI SAFETY SUMMIT
TO DISCUSS NEW APPROACHES,
INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF THEIR
NEW AI SAFETY INSTITUTE. NOW AN
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF
RESPONSIBLE AI IS PROMOTING THE
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOUR
CONSUMERS AND THE APPLICATIONS
THAT ARE SAFE THAT AVOID HARMFUL
OUTPUTS AND THAT STAY WITHIN
YOUR COMPANY'S GUIDELINES. AND
THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO
ACTUALLY PLACE LIMITS ON WHAT
INFORMATION THE MODELS CAN AND
CAN'T RETURN. AND WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD HERE, AND TODAY
WE'RE ANNOUNCING GUARDRAILS FOR
AMAZON BEDROCK. NOW THIS IS A
NEW CAPABILITY THAT HELPS YOU
EASILY SAFEGUARD YOUR GENERATIVE
AI APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR
RESPONSIBLE AI POLICIES TO
CREATE A GUARDRAIL. BEDROCK
PROVIDES CONFIGURATION WIZARD SO
YOU CAN ENTER A NATURAL LANGUAGE
DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPICS THAT
YOU WANT. THE MODEL TO AVOID.
GUARDRAILS CAN BE USED WITH ANY
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS
ACCESSIBLE VIA BEDROCK,
INCLUDING THE CUSTOM MODELS THAT
YOU CREATE THROUGH YOUR OWN FINE
TUNING AND YOU CAN ALSO USE
GUARDRAILS WITH AGENTS. SO NOW
YOU CAN HAVE A CONSISTENT LEVEL
OF PROTECTION ACROSS ALL OF YOUR
GENAI GENAI DEVELOPMENT
ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, A BANK
COULD CONFIGURE AN ONLINE
ASSISTANT TO REFRAIN FROM
PROVIDING INVESTMENT ADVICE OR
TO PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT
. AN E COMMERCE SITE COULD
ENSURE THAT ITS ONLINE ASSISTANT
DOESN'T USE HATE SPEECH OR
INSULTS OR A UTILITY COMPANY
COULD REMOVE PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR PII
FROM A CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL
SUMMARY. SO WE'RE APPROACHING
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF GENERATIVE
AI IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT
WAY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT
IT TAKES TO REINVENT. HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO BUILD WITH THIS
TECHNOLOGY? WE JUST, AS YOU'VE
USED AWS TO REINVENT HOW YOU'VE
BUILT AND INNOVATE IT FOR YEARS
AND ULTIMATELY TO TRANSFORM HOW
YOUR ORGANIZATION OPERATES,
WHETHER YOU'RE MIGRATING
ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS,
BUILDING THE NEXT HOT STARTUP OR
OR DEPLOYING YOUR GENERATIVE AI
STRATEGY. OUR APPROACH REMAINS
THE SAME. UM, CUSTOMER
OBSESSION, INNOVATION AND A LONG
TERM VIEW OF WHAT JOINT SUCCESS
REALLY MEANS. TO TELL US MORE
ABOUT HOW HER COMPANY IS BUILT
ON AWS AND IS NOW REINVENTING
WITH GENERATIVE AI, PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE LIDIA
FONSECA, THE CHIEF DIGITAL AND
TECHNICAL OFFICER OF PFIZER.
THANK EVERYBODY. I'D LIKE TO
START BY ASKING HOW MANY
PATIENTS DO YOU THINK PFIZER
TREATED LAST YEAR? YOU MAY BE
THINKING IN THE MILLIONS, BUT IN
FACT WE TREATED 1.3 BILLION
PATIENTS WITH OUR MEDICINES AND
VACCINES. THAT'S ONE OUT OF SIX
HUMANS ON THE PLANET. A TRULY
HUMBLING, ACCOMPLISHED AGENT.
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE
RECOGNIZED AS AN INNOVATIVE AND
ETHICAL COMPANY LISTED IN
FORTUNE'S WORLD'S MOST ADMIRED
COMPANIES. FORBES WORLD'S BEST
EMPLOYERS, AND TIME MAGAZINE'S
WORLD'S BEST COMPANIES, PFIZER
IS EXPERIENCING AN EXCITING
PERIOD OF INNOVATION AND GROWTH
WITH THE LAUNCH OF 90 MEDICINES
AND VACCINES IN 18 MONTHS. THIS
HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BY US OR ANY
OTHER PHARMA COMPANY. IT IS AN
INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS GOAL AND WE
ARE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 13
ALREADY LAUNCHED DIGITAL DATA
AND AI ARE CRITICAL TO OUR
SUCCESS. AS AND WHAT
DIFFERENTIATES PFIZER IS THAT WE
APPLY THIS ACROSS ALL BUSINESS
UNITS. OUR 36 PLANTS AND THE 149
MARKETS THAT WE SERVE QUICKLY
AND AT SCALE TO BRING MEDICINES
TO PATIENTS FASTER. OUR SUCCESS
TODAY RESTS ON THE GROUNDWORK WE
LAID FOR TECHNOLOGY AND AI TO
FLOURISH. CENTRAL IZING OUR
DATA, CREATE STANDARD PLATFORMS,
CULTIVATING STRONG TALENT AND
BUILDING A SECURE FOUNDATION IN
ALL TO INNOVATE FOR MAXIMUM
IMPACT. WE COULD NOT HAVE
ACHIEVED THIS TREMENDOUS REACH
WITHOUT OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
WITH AWS. SO LET ME SHARE A BIT
ABOUT OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER. IN
2019 PFIZER AND AWS CREATED A
PIONEERING SCIENCE DATA CLOUD
THAT AGGREGATES MULTIMODAL DATA
FROM HUNDREDS OF LABORATORY
INSTRUMENTS, EMPOWERING OUR
SCIENTISTS TO SEARCH ALL
HISTORICAL MOLECULE AND COMPOUND
DATA IN REAL TIME COMPARED TO
WEEKS OR MONTHS IN OUR PRIOR
FRAGMENTED ENVIRONMENT AND THE
SCIENTIFIC DATA CLOUD
ACCELERATES ANALYSIS AND
COMPUTATION OF RESEARCH AND WITH
AI ALGORITHMS THAT HELP US
IDENTIFY AND DESIGN THE MOST
PROMISING NEW MOLECULES IS
BUILDING ON THAT SUCCESS IN
2021. PFIZER EMBARKED ON ONE OF
OUR BOLDEST INITIATIVE IS GOING
FROM 10% OF OUR CORE IN THE TO
CLOUD 80% MOVING IN 12,000
APPLICATIONS AND 8000 SERVERS IN
42 WEEKS. ONE OF THE FASTEST
MIGRATIONS FOR A COMPANY OUR
SIZE. THIS MOVE TO AWS SAVED US
$47 MILLION A YEAR AND HELPED US
EXIT THREE DATA CENTERS,
REDUCING 4700 TONS OF CO2
EMISSIONS OR THE EQUIVALENT
ENERGY USE BY 1000 HOMES IN A
YEAR. BUT VERY IMPORTANT ALI. IT
ENABLED US TO INNOVATE WITH
SPEED AND AT SCALE. FOR EXAMPLE,
WE REDUCED TIME TO SET UP
COMPUTING CAPACITY FROM MONTHS
TO HOURS, SPEEDING UP DATA
GENERATION FOR DRUG SUBMISSIONS
BY. 75. AND WHEN COVID HIT, AWS
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO OFFER
THEIR HELP, SCALING US INTO THE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL
CORES IN THE CLOUD AND
ACCELERATING MANUFACTURING AND
CLINICAL TRIALS. WHEN WE RAN
COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE
ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO
MANUFACTURE OUR COVID VACCINE,
AWS JUMPED IN WITH ADDITIONAL
CPUS FOR US TO MOVE FAST. AND
WHEN WE NEEDED TO SUBMIT DATA TO
THE FDA IN UNDER A DAY,
INCREASED OUR CAPACITY IN
ENABLING PFIZER TO MOVE AT THE
SPEED OF SCIENCE. IN FACT, IT
TOOK JUST 269 DAYS FROM WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED OUR PLANS TO DEVELOP A
COVID 19 VACCINE WITH BIONTECH
TO THE DAY THAT WE RECEIVED THE
FDA'S EMERGENCY USE
AUTHORIZATION ACTION. THIS
NORMALLY TAKES 8 TO 10 YEARS.
THANK YOU. WITH THE WORLD
WAITING, WE NEEDED TO
MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE THE
VACCINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
WE HELD FIRM TO OUR MANTRA
SCIENCE WILL WIN. WELL WHILE
SCIENCE DID WIN AND DIGITAL
HELPED US DO IT FASTER, PFIZER
OUR INDUSTRY LEADING DIGITAL
OPERATIONS CENTER ALLOWED US
COLLEAGUES TO SEE PRODUCTION
STATUS ACROSS PLANTS AND RESOLVE
ISSUES IN REAL TIME, YIELDING A
20% THROUGHPUT INCREASE. OUR
MRNA PREDICTION ALGORITHM
YIELDED 20,000 MORE VACCINE
DOSES PER BATCH. IMAGINE THE
LIVES IMPACT IT. TO GIVE YOU AN
IDEA OF THE SCALE, PRIOR TO
COVID, PFIZER PRODUCED 220
MILLION VACCINE DOSES IN TOTAL
AND SCALED TO 4 BILLION OF
COMMUNITY IN 2022. THIS IS NOW
AT THE HEART OF HOW OUR PLANTS
OPERATE, AND WE'RE APPLYING
THESE INNOVATIONS TO THE TO OUR
OTHER MEDICINES AND VACCINES.
MORE RECENTLY, AWS HELPED US
APPLY AI TO GENERATE ALERTS
ABOUT POTENTIAL SUPPLY CHAIN
DISRUPTIONS, PROMPTING US TO
REROUTE SHIPMENTS TO CONTINUE
DELIVERING MEDICINES TO CLINICAL
TRIAL SITES AHEAD OF HURRICANE
IAN'S LANDFALL. DIGITAL AI MADE
IT POSSIBLE FOR PFIZER TO BRING
MEDICINES TO PATIENTS AROUND THE
GLOBE FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE.
NOW LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S NEXT.
AS YOU HEARD, PFIZER HAS BEEN
HARNESSING AI TO DRIVE
INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY ON A
GLOBAL SCALE. AND MORE RECENTLY,
WE ARE LEVERAGING GENERATIVE AI,
WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO DELIVER
ANNUAL COST SAVINGS OF 750
MILLION TO $1 BILLION IN THE
NEAR TERM. SOME REAL TANGIBLE
VALUE TO USING AWS CLOUD
SERVICES. PFIZER QUICKLY
DEPLOYED FOX OUR INTERNAL
GENERATIVE AI PLATFORM ALLOWING
COLLEAGUES TO ACCESS LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS AVAILABLE IN
AMAZON BEDROCK AND SAGEMAKER AWS
BREADTH OF SERVICES AND THE
VARIETY OF LMS IN BEDROCK MEANS
WE CAN SELECT THE BEST TOOLS FOR
USE CASES IN R&D, MANUFACTURE,
MARKETING AND MORE ENABLING
PFIZER AND AWS TO PROTOTYPE 17
DIFFERENT USE CASES IN A MATTER
OF WEEKS. I IN GENERATIVE AI
WILL HELP US IDENTIFY NEW
ONCOLOGY TARGETS, A PROCESS THAT
IS LARGELY MANUAL TODAY WITH AI,
WE CAN SEARCH AND COLLATE
RELEVANT DATA AND SCIENTIFIC
CONTENT FROM MANY MORE SOURCES
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME AND
ALGORITHMS GENERATE AND VALIDATE
POTENTIAL TARGETS TO IMPROVE OUR
SCIENTIFIC SUCCESS WITH BEDROCK,
WE CAN SCAN THE MARKETPLACE FOR
COMPANIES AND ASSETS AUTOMATING
THE CREATION OF COMPANY PROFILES
TO PRIORITIZE POTENTIAL
ACQUISITION ROLES IN
MANUFACTURING. BEDROCK TAKES THE
OPTIMAL PROCESS PARAMETERS TO
IDENTIFY WHAT WE CALL THE GOLDEN
BATCH AND USES GENERATIVE AI TO
DETECT ANOMALIES AND RECOMMEND
ACTIONS TO OUR OPERATORS IN REAL
TIME. AIMING TO IMPROVE CYCLE
TIME BY 25% AWS IS AGILE CULTURE
ALIGNS WELL WITH PFIZER'S
LIGHTSAIL LEAD WAY OF WORKING.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING ON
OUR LEARNINGS TO UNDERSTAND AND
NOT JUST HOW AI CAN TRANSFORM
OUR DAILY WORK, BUT HOW IT MAY
HELP US DISRUPT THE INDUSTRY.
ORI TO CLOSE, WE'RE EXCITED TO
ACCELERATE OUR BATTLE AGAINST
CANCER. WITH PFIZER'S PROPOSED
ACQUISITION OF CDN, A BIOTECH
FOCUSED ON CANCER THERAPY. AS WE
PLAN TO BRING JENS LEADING EDGE
ANTIBODY DRUG CONJUGATE
TECHNOLOGY TO MORE PATIENTS WITH
CANCER, FASTER. YOU SEE, WE HOPE
TO ACHIEVE WITH CANCER WHAT WE
WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH COVID.
OUR WORK WITH THE AWS WILL HELP
US CONTINUE THIS GREAT MOMENTUM
FUELING OUR AMBITION TO CHANGE A
BILLION LIVES EVERY YEAR, NOT
JUST IN A PANDEMIC YEAR. THANK
YOU, AWS FOR HELPING PFIZER
BRING BREAKTHROUGHS TO PATIENTS
FASTER BECAUSE IN THE BATTLE
AGAINST DISEASE, TIME IS LIFE.
THANK YOU ALL. ONE OUT OF EVERY
SIX PEOPLE ON THE PLANET ARE
IMPACTED BY PFIZER. I MEAN, THAT
IS JUST SO IMPRESSIVE. SO
IMPRESSIVE. LYDIA MEANS SO MUCH
TO US, HONESTLY, THAT YOU'VE
TRUSTED AWS TO. TO HELP DELIVER
ALL THESE CAPABILITIES. THESE
BREAKTHROUGHS THAT ARE CHANGING
PEOPLE'S LIVES. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. AND THANK YOU, ADAM AWS
HAS JUST BEEN AN AMAZING
PARTNER. THANK YOU. WE LOOK
FORWARD TO MORE. THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. SO
ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE
ARE USING AWS FOR AGILITY FOR
SPEED AND FOR THE SCALE THAT
THEY NEED TO DRIVE THEIR
FUTURES. BUT THIS REQUIRES
EMPLOYEES WITH TOP NOTCH CLOUD
SKILLS. AND WE KNOW THAT NOT
ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE THAT CLOUD
EXPERTISE AND THAT THERE'S A
LARGE SKILL GAP THAT'S GOT TO BE
CLOSED. SO GENERATIVE AI IS OF
COURSE, THE NEXT INCREDIBLY
EXCITING NEW OPPORTUNITY. BUT
IT'S ONLY GOING TO ADD TO THAT
GAP. AND SO WE'RE INVESTING TO
HELP PROVIDE THE CLOUD SCALE
SKILLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
NEEDED ACROSS THE WORLD FOR
YEARS TO COME. AWS IS COMMITTED
TO TRAINING 29 MILLION PEOPLE
FOR FREE WITH CLOUD COMPUTING
SKILLS BY THE YEAR 2025. AND
WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 21
MILLION ALREADY TRAINED. AND WE
JUST LAUNCHED WE JUST RECENTLY
LAUNCHED THE AWS CLOUD
INSTITUTE, WHICH IS PROVIDING
DEEP CLOUD EXPERTISE TO HELP
STUDENTS LAUNCH AN ENTIRE CLOUD
CAREER. AND WE'VE ALSO LAUNCHED
100 DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING
AND AI COURSES AND RESOURCES TO
SUPPORT INNOVATION AND JUST OVER
A WEEK AGO, WE ANNOUNCED AI
READY, WHICH IS OUR NEW
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE FREE AI
SKILLS TO ANOTHER 2 MILLION
PEOPLE BY 2025 AND TO HELP
STUDENTS AROUND THE WORLD WITH
TO LEARN THE FOUNDATION SKILLS
AND TO PREPARE FOR A CAREER IN
TECH. WE ACTUALLY CREATED AN AI
AND MACHINE LEARNING SCHOLARSHIP
FUND. LET'S MEET SOME OF THE
RECIPIENT. THIS. MY NAME IS
VANIA GAREWAL. MY NAME IS JOSE
TAPIA. MY NAME IS OLYMPIA
OTIENO. WITHOUT THE AI/ML
SCHOLARSHIP, I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP MY OWN
QUESTIONS. KNOW WHAT TOOLS ARE
AVAILABLE TO SOLVE THEM. THE
NANODEGREE IS DEFINITELY
UNLOCKED. MY INTEREST IN AI
CONSTANTLY TRY TO GO OUT THERE
AND TALK TO GIRLS WHO ARE
CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN
LIFE IN KENYA DUE TO CROP
DISEASE WIZ THE RATES AT WHICH
THE YIELDS HAVE BEEN DROPPING IS
DEVASTATING. SO MY COLLEAGUES
AND I HAVE MADE A MOBILE
APPLICATION WITH AI FARMERS
PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE CROP
DISEASES. THE FACT THAT I WAS
ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM,
I NOW KNOW THAT I AM CAPABLE OF
DOING WELL IN THIS FIELD. I
MEAN, THIS IS WHY WE DO THIS
STUFF, RIGHT? WHAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE
JOSE AND OLYMPIA HERE WITH US
TODAY. SO COME ON, LET'S GIVE
THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THERE
WE GO. TO BOTH OF YOU. I'M SO
PROUD. I'M REALLY PROUD OF WHAT
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE. AND I JUST
REALLY HOPE THAT REINVENT THIS
WEEK IS JUST A GREAT, GREAT
EXPERIENCE FOR YOU. THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR LETTING US SHARE YOUR
STORIES AND FOR EVERYONE
WATCHING, WE WANT TO EMPOWER ALL
OF YOU TO BUILD AND TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF IMPACT. AND WE SEE A
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THAT BY
INFUSING GENERATIVE AI INTO ALL
OF THE SYSTEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE
USING INTO THEIR DAILY LIVES. WE
BELIEVE THAT GENERATIVE AI
SHOULD HELP EVERYONE AT WORK
SEAMLESSLY WITH HELPFUL,
RELEVANT ASSISTANCE. WHETHER OR
NOT, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST THING
ABOUT FOUNDATION MODELS IS RAG
OR ANY OF THE REST. AND THAT
BRINGS US TO THE TOP OF THE
STACK, THE APPLICATIONS THAT YOU
USE THAT ARE POWERED BY
GENERATIVE AI, LEVERAGING
FOUNDATION MODELS. WE BELIEVE
THAT GENERATIVE AI, OF COURSE,
HAS THE POTENTIAL OVER TIME TO
TRANSFORM VIRTUALLY EVERY
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THAT WE
KNOW. IT CAN POUR THROUGH THE
NOOKS AND CRANNIES OF A SYSTEM
AND ACTUALLY HELP YOU FIND DATA
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
EXISTED. AND THEN HELP YOU PUT
IT TO OPTIMAL USE. IT CAN
GENERATE INSIGHTS THAT CAN SAVE
HOURS OF MANUAL WORK AND IT CAN
TAKE PROJECTS THAT WERE SLOGS
AND MAKE THEM A SNAP. NOW, ONE
IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS HOW
GENERATIVE AI CAN MAKE THE TASK
OF WRITING CODE RADICALLY
FASTER. AND SO LAST YEAR WE
RELEASED AMAZON CODEWHISPERER,
WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD GENERATIVE
AI, WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD
APPLICATIONS, I SHOULD SAY,
FASTER AND MORE SECURELY BY
GENERATING CODE SUGGESTIONS IN
NEAR REAL TIME. NOW WITH
CODEWHISPERER DEVELOPERS USE A
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPT AND THEN
RECEIVE ACCURATE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN EVERY POPULAR IDE
. AND FOR 15 OF THE MOST POPULAR
PROGRAMING LANGUAGES, A
CODEWHISPERER GIVES DEVELOPERS A
POWERFUL BOOST FOR GENERAL CODE
EXAMPLES. AND OF COURSE WE MADE
SURE THAT IT'S GREAT FOR
PROVIDING SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS
FOR CODE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
WARNER MUSIC GROUP, THE
BUNDESLIGA AND THE CIGNA GROUP
HAVE EMBRACED CODEWHISPERER TO
ACCELERATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT
CAPABILITIES, AND TATA
CONSULTANCY SERVICES, AWS,
ACCENTURE AND HCLTECH ARE MAKING
CODEWHISPERER AVAILABLE TO TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES EACH.
NOW COHEN IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN
THE ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR
INDUSTRY. THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT CODEWHISPERER IS A GAME
CHANGER FOR THEM AND WE WANT AS
MANY DEVELOPERS AS POSSIBLE TO
REAP THE BENEFITS. AND SO WHAT
WE'VE DONE IS TO MAKE CODE
WHISPERER, TO MAKE THE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN IT FREE, FREE FOR
INDIVIDUAL USE. NOW THE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CODE
WHISPERS ARE GREAT FOR GENERAL
CODING TASKS, BUT GENERAL CODING
SUGGESTIONS CAN ONLY GET YOUR
DEVELOPERS SO FAR. IMAGINE
YOU'VE JUST HIRED A NEW
DEVELOPER FOR EVEN IF THEY ARE
WORLD CLASS, THEY ARE NOT GOING
TO DO THEIR BEST WORK UNTIL THEY
UNDERSTAND YOUR CODE BASE AND
YOUR INTERNAL BEST PRACTICES. AN
AI POWERED CODING TOOLS ARE
SIMILAR. YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT
TOOL, BUT FOR THE KIND OF SPEED
AND RELEVANCY THAT MAKES THE
MOST DIFFERENCE, YOUR SOLUTION
HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF
YOUR CODE AND THE BEST PLACE TO
FIND THAT CONTEXT IS INSIDE OF
YOUR INTERNAL APIS, YOUR
LIBRARIES AND YOUR PACKAGES.
THAT'S WHY A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AGO WE PREVIEWED A CAPABILITY
THAT ALLOWS CODEWHISPERER TO
SECURELY LEARN FROM YOUR
INTERNAL CODE BASE TO PROVIDE
MUCH, MUCH MORE PERTINENT,
CUSTOMIZED AND USEFUL CODE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS. CODEWHISPERER IS
AN EXPERT ON YOUR CODE AND CAN
PROVIDE MUCH MORE TAILORED
SUGGESTIONS. CREATING AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR INTERNAL
SDKS, YOUR APIS, YOUR LANGUAGES
AND YOUR CLASSES. AND OF COURSE
ANY CUSTOMIZATIONS ARE ISOLATE
AND WE NEVER USE CUSTOMERS
CONTENT FROM CODEWHISPERER TO
TRAIN ANY OF OUR UNDERLYING
MODELS. NOW TO UNDERSTAND THE
IMPACT OF THIS KIND OF
CUSTOMIZATION, WE WORKED WITH
PERSISTENT A DIGITAL ENGINEERING
PROVIDER. NOW
THEIR STUDIES SHOWED THAT
DEVELOPERS USING CODEWHISPERER
COMPLETED THEIR TASKS AN
ADDITIONAL 28% FASTER WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS THAN WITHOUT 28.
AND AWS IS THE ONLY MAJOR CLOUD
PROVIDER THAT'S CURRENTLY
AUTHORIZING OFFERING A
CUSTOMIZED CAPABILITY THAT
ANYONE CAN SIGN UP FOR AND USE
TODAY. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT CODEWHISPERER ABOUT
CODEWHISPERER CUSTOMIZATIONS AND
HOW IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU
ACCELERATE YOUR WORK AND
INCREASE YOUR IMPACT. BUT WE'RE
JUST GETTING STARTED AND WE SEE
A LOT MORE POTENTIAL USES WITH
GENERATIVE AI. FOR EXAMPLE,
THINK ABOUT GENERATIVE AI CHAT
APPLICATIONS. SO THESE DAYS IT
SEEMS LIKE JUST ABOUT EVERYONE
IS EXPERIMENTING WITH THEM,
RIGHT? AND WHAT THE EARLY
PROVIDERS IN THIS SPACE HAVE
DONE IS REALLY EXCITING AND IT'S
GENUINELY SUPER USEFUL FOR
CONSUMER OWNERS. BUT IN A LOT OF
WAYS, THESE APPLICATIONS DON'T
REALLY WORK AT WORK. THEY'RE
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR
CAPABILITIES ARE GREAT, BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR COMPANY. THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR DATA, YOUR
CUSTOMERS OR YOUR OPERATIONS.
AND THIS LIMITS HOW HOW USEFUL
THEIR SUGGESTIONS CAN BE. THEY
ALSO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHO
YOU ARE AT WORK. THEY DON'T KNOW
YOUR ROLE, YOUR PREFERENCES,
WHAT INFORMATION YOU USE AND
WHAT YOU DO, AND DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO. SO CRITICALLY. OTHER
PROVIDERS WHO HAVE LAUNCHED
TOOLS, THEY'VE LAUNCHED THEM
WITHOUT DATA PRIVACY AND
SECURITY CAPABILITIES. THE
VIRTUE ALI EVERY ENTERPRISE
REQUIRES. AND SO MANY CIOS
ACTUALLY BANNED THE USE OF A LOT
OF THESE MOST POPULAR CHAT
ASSISTANTS INSIDE THEIR
ORGANIZATIONS. AND THIS HAS BEEN
WELL PUBLICIZED AND JUST ASK ANY
CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY
OFFICER OR CSO AND THEY'LL TELL
YOU YOU CAN'T REALLY BOLT ON
SECURITY AFTER THE FACT. AND
EXPECT IT TO WORK AS WELL. IT'S
MUCH, MUCH BETTER TO BUILD
SECURITY INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL
DESIGN OF THE TECHNOLOGY. SO
WHEN WE SET OUT TO BUILD
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS, WE
KNEW WE HAD TO ADDRESS THESE
GAPS, HAD TO BE BUILT IN FROM
THE VERY START. RIGHT? AND
THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M REALLY
PROUD AND EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
AMAZON MQ A NEW TYPE OF
GENERATIVE AI POWERED ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO WORK FOR YOU AT WORK
. Q LETS YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS
QUICKLY WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE
INTERACTIONS, YOU CAN EASILY
CHAT, GENERATE CONTENT, TAKE
ACTIONS, AND IT'S ALL INFORMED
BY AN UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA REPOSITOR WIZ
YOUR OPERATIONS. AND OF COURSE
WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT ROCK SOLID
SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARE. SO Q
UNDERSTANDS AND RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING IDENTITIES, YOUR ROLES
AND YOUR PERMISSIONS. IF A USER
DOES NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO
ACCESS SOMETHING WITHOUT Q, THEY
CANNOT ACCESS IT WITH Q EITHER.
AND WE'VE DESIGNED Q TO MEET
ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS AND
ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS STRINGENT
REQUIREMENTS FROM DAY ONE. AND
WE NEVER WANT BUSINESS CUSTOMERS
CONTENT. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
USE THAT CONTENT FOR. Q TO TRAIN
UNDERLYING MODELS. I REALLY
BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO BE
TRANSFORMATIVE. WE WANT LOTS OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO DO
LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
TO BENEFIT FROM AMAZON. Q NOW,
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. WE WANT Q
TO HELP DEVELOPERS AND BUILDERS
BE MORE EFFICIENT, MORE
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND MORE
PROFICIENT. SO FOR STARTERS,
AMAZON Q IS YOUR EXPERT
ASSISTANT FOR BUILDING ON AWS
NOW TO SUPERCHARGE WORK FOR
DEVELOPERS AND IT PROS? WE'VE
TRAINED AMAZON Q ON 17 YEARS
WORTH OF KNOWLEDGE SO IT CAN
TRANSFORM THE WAY YOU THINK,
OPTIMIZE AND OPERATE
APPLICATIONS AND WORKLOADS ON
AWS AND WE'VE PUT AMAZON. Q
WHERE YOU WORK, SO IT'S READY TO
ASSIST YOU IN THE AWS MANAGEMENT
CONSOLE AND DOCUMENTATION CHAN
IN YOUR IDP VIA CODEWHISPERER
AND IN YOUR TEAM CHAT ROOMS LIKE
SLACK, YOU CAN CHAT WITH AWS
CLOUD TO EXPLORE AWS
CAPABILITIES, LEARN UNFAMILIAR
TECHNOLOGIES, ARCHITECT
SOLUTIONS. ITS AN EXPERT IN AWS
WELL-ARCHITECTED PATTERNS LEARNS
BEST PRACTICES AND SOLUTION
IMPLEMENTATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK AMAZON Q HOW DO I
BUILD A WEB APPLICATION WITH
AWS? WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? IT'S
GOING TO ANSWER WITH A LIST OF
POTENTIAL SERVICES THAT YOU
COULD USE, SUCH AS AMPLIFY,
LAMBDA OR EC2, AND THEN IT'S
GOING TO OFFER REASONS WHY YOU
MIGHT CONSIDER EACH SERVICE.
FROM THERE YOU CAN FURTHER
NARROW DOWN YOUR OPTIONS THROUGH
NATURAL LANGUAGE, LIKE WHICH OF
THESE WOULD BE PREFERRED? IF MY
APP IS ONLY NEEDS TO RUN FOR A
FEW SECONDS AND ONLY HAS VERY
INFREQUENT TRAFFIC LAMBDA AMAZON
Q IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR
REQUIREMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION
AND IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE YOU
WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ONCE YOU'VE
CHOSEN A SERVICE, YOU CAN ASK
AMAZON. Q HOW DO I GET STARTED?
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU STEP
BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR
CONFIGURING THE SOLUTION PLUS
LINKS TO RELEVANT INFORMATION TO
DOCUMENT STATION AND SO ON. AND
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF
HOW AMAZON Q IS GOING TO HELP
YOU WITH YOUR WORK. FOR EXAMPLE,
IF YOU ENCOUNTER AN ERROR WITH
LAMBDA IN THE CONSOLE, YOU JUST
PRESS THE TROUBLESHOOT ROUTE
WITH AMAZON Q BUTTON, AND Q IS
GOING TO RESEARCH THE ERROR, AND
IT'S GOING TO SUGGEST HOW TO FIX
IT. AMAZON. Q CAN ALSO
TROUBLESHOOT YOUR NETWORK
CONNECTIONS AND IT CAN ANALYZE
YOUR END TO END NETWORK
CONFIGURATION AND HELP RESOLVE
OF CONNECTIVITY ISSUES QUICKLY.
THAT IS A HUGE TIME SAVER. NOW
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU HELP US WITH?
HOW ABOUT CHOOSING THE OPTIMAL
EC2 INSTANCE SO YOU CAN JUST
TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR WORKLOAD AND
GET AN ACCURATE, QUICK AND
ECONOMICAL INSTANCE TYPE
RECOMMENDATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
WHICH EC2 INSTANCE TYPES PROVIDE
THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE FOR
VIDEO ENCODING AND TRANSCODING
WORKLOADS SUPPORTING GAMING USE
CASES AND YOU GET YOUR
RECOMMENDATION. IT'S THAT EASY.
THIS IS ALL VERY COOL AND WE
EXPECT THAT AMAZON Q IS GOING TO
SAVE CUSTOMERS SO MUCH TIME IN
ARCHITECTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
AND OPTIMIZING YOUR WORKLOADS.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL THE Q CAN DO
FOR YOU. AMAZON Q IS ALSO GOING
TO BE IN THE IDP FOR DEVELOPERS.
IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE
CODE IN THE IDE OR YOU NEED TO
DIG IN INTO HOW A SPECIFIC
FUNCTION WORKS, AMAZON, Q AND
CODEWHISPERER IS GOING TO HELP
YOU GET UP TO SPEED BY USING ITS
DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF AWS AND ITS
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR CODE BASES
. SO YOU NEED TO ADD TESTS. JUST
ASK Q AND IT'S GOING TO
AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE THE TEST
FOR YOU. AND THIS IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
DEVELOPERS. BUT WE KNEW WE COULD
DO EVEN MORE TO HELP YOU BUILD
EVEN FASTER. FOR EXAMPLE, THINK
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO
BUILDING A NEW FEATURE. YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENTS.
THINK THROUGH DESIGN, WRITE ALL
THE CODE, ADD TESTS, DOCUMENT
THE CODE AND SO ON, AND A FILE
COULD SPAN HUNDREDS TO EVEN
THOUSANDS OF LINES OF CODE. AND
THIS IS A DAUNTING TASK. IF
YOU'RE USING AMAZON
CODEWHISPERER IT'S GOING TO
GENERATE CHUNKS OF NEW CODE FOR
YOU, WHICH IS A REAL TIME SAVER
THAT STILL LEAVES ALL THE REST.
SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR
AMAZON. Q SPECIFICALLY, Q'S
FEATURE DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY,
WHICH IS GOING TO AUTOMATE THE
MULTI STEP DEVELOPMENT TASK OF
ADDING NEW FEATURES TO YOUR
APPLICATION. SO INSTEAD OF ALL
THAT WORK NOW YOU JUST WRITE A
PROMPT AND Q IS GOING TO USE ITS
EXPERTISE ENRICHED WITH AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR PROJECT
CODE, AND IT'S GOING TO DO ALL
THE HEAVY LIFTING FOR YOU. SO
AMAZON Q WILL CREATE THE DRAFT
PLAN, WHICH YOU CAN THEN
COLLABORATE AND ITERATIVELY
IMPROVE USING NATURAL LANGUAGE
CHAT UNTIL IT'S POLISHED AND
READY TO GO. AND THEN Q REALLY
KICKS INTO GEAR. IT'S GOING TO
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN ACROSS YOUR
FILES IN YOUR APPLICATION. AN
AND YOU REMAIN IN CONTROL USING
YOUR EXPERTISE TO REVIEW CHANGES
AND ENSURE THE VERY BEST
QUALITY. SO THIS IS HOURS OF
WORK THAT Q CAN DO FOR YOU WITH
JUST ONE GOOD PROMPT. AND THIS
FEATURE IS AVAILABLE TODAY IN
AMAZON CODE CATALYST AND WILL
SOON BE FULLY AVAILABLE IN THE
IDE. YOU WILL NOT CURRENTLY FIND
AN AI ASSISTANT FROM ANOTHER
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER THAT CAN DO
THIS FOR YOU TODAY. BUT WE'RE
NOT DONE YET. LET'S KEEP GOING.
WE KNOW THAT DEVELOPERS SPEND A
LOT OF TIME SLOGGING THROUGH THE
MUCK THAT COMES WITH MAINTENANCE
AND UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE AND
UPGRADES. BIG DEAL, RIGHT? SO
TAKE TAKE LANGUAGE VERSION
UPGRADES, FOR EXAMPLE. HOW MANY
OF YOU ARE USING OLDER VERSIONS
OF JAVA? BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO
TAKE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS TO
UPGRADE HANDS? OH YEAH. A LOT OF
THEM. SO MIGRATIONS ARE
INEVITABLY COME WITH A LOT OF
NUANCE AND EDGE CASES. AND SO
YOU END UP SPENDING A TON OF
TIME WRITING AND REWRITING THE
CODE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND
TRYING TO GET IT COMPILE TO
COMPILE AND WORK. AND SOMETIMES
THESE PROGRAMS TAKE SO LONG THAT
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE IN A
MIGRATION INFINITY LOOP. JUST AS
ONE ENDS, THE NEXT BEGINS. AND
IT'S NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE
TEMPTATION TO JUST MAINTAIN
STATUS QUO. BUT DOING THAT MEANS
THAT YOU MISS OUT ON PERFORMANCE
IMPROVEMENTS AND IT MEANS MUCH
WORSE THAT IT CAN ALSO OPEN YOU
UP TO POTENTIAL SECURITY
VULNERABILITIES. AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT INTO AMAZON. Q CODE
TRANSFORMATION, WHICH HELPS YOU
WITH UPGRADES TO TRANSFORM CODE
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME THAT
IT TAKES TODAY. ALL THE
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO ALL A
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO IS ASK YOU
TO PERFORM THE CODE
TRANSFORMATION AND IT HANDLES
THE REST FROM IDENTIFYING AND
UPGRADING AND MANDATORY CODE
PACKAGE DEPOSITORIES AND
FRAMEWORKS TO REPLACING
DEPRECATED CODE AND
INCORPORATING SECURITY BEST
PRACTICES. CUZ EVEN GOING TO RUN
TESTS ON THE UPGRADED
APPLICATION VERSION. SO WE'VE
BEEN USING THIS, THIS
APPLICATION, THIS THIS
CAPABILITY INTERNALLY AND THE
RESULTS ARE STUNNING. SO WITH
AMAZON Q TRANSFORMATION IN A
VERY SMALL TEAM OF AMAZON
DEVELOPERS SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADED
1000 APPLICATIONS FROM JAVA
EIGHT TO JAVA 17 IN JUST TWO
DAYS. NOW I'M GOING TO SAY THAT
AGAIN, 1000 APPLICATION UPGRADES
IN TWO DAYS. THAT'S HOW LONG A
SINGLE APPLICATION UPGRADE USED
TO TAKE. I MEAN, THIS IS MONTHS,
MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS OF
DEVELOPER TIME SAVED A LOT OF
VERY HAPPY PEOPLE AT AMAZON OVER
THIS. I PROMISE YOU. SO TODAY,
AMAZON. Q CAN WORK ITS MAGIC ON
JAVA UPGRADES, BUT SOON YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT TO
HELP MIGRATE YOUR NETWORK LOADS
FROM WINDOWS TO LINUX. AND THERE
ARE A LOT OF APPLICATIONS OUT
THERE STUCK ON WINDOWS BECAUSE
OF THE SHEER EFFORT REQUIRED IN
MAKING THE MIGRATION. AND THIS
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HUGE COST
SAVINGS ON COSTLY LICENSING FEES
ON TOP OF THE INHERENT
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY
BENEFITS. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE
OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION? ALL THE FOLKS IN
MARKETING, FINANCE, HR, PRODUCT
MANAGEMENT AND MORE? THERE'S SO
MUCH INFORMATION SPREAD ACROSS
YOUR ORGANIZATION'S DOCUMENTS,
VASS ALL OF YOUR DATA, ALL OF
YOUR APPLICATIONS, ASIANS AND
PEOPLE IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
ROLES, THEY STRUGGLE EVERY DAY
TO FIND THE INFORMATION THAT
THEY NEED TO AND THEN TRANSFORM
IT INTO MAKING DECISIONS AND
TAKING ACTIONS AND DOING THAT
FAST ENOUGH TO STAY COMPETITIVE,
OF FINDING RELEVANT INFORMATION,
MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS, TAKING
ACTION THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR,
RIGHT? YEP AMAZON. Q IS ALSO
YOUR BUSINESS EXPERT. Q HAS
CONNECTIONS TO OVER 40 POPULAR
ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS, SO EMPLOYEES
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION CAN ASK
COMPLEX QUESTIONS AND GET
DETAILED, ACCURATE, NUANCED
ANSWERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO
THEIR ROLE AT WORK. AND AGAIN,
SECURE IS SECURE AND Q IS SECURE
AND PRIVATE. IT RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING ROLES AND THE
PERMISSIONS THAT ARE GRANTED
UNIQUELY TO EACH USER. WE'RE
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, AND I
ACTUALLY WANTED TO SHOW YOU JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF AMAZON. Q AND
FOR YOUR BUSINESS IN ACTION. SO
TO PUT THROUGH Q PUT Q THROUGH
ITS PACES. PLEASE WELCOME AWS
OWN DR. MATT WOOD TO THE STAGE.
THANKS, ADAM, AND GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE. I'M EXCITED TO GIVE
YOU A FIRST LOOK AT AMAZON. Q A
NEW TYPE OF AI ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO BE AN EXPERT IN YOUR
BUSINESS WITH AMAZON. Q YOU CAN
GET QUICK, ACCURATE, RELEVANT
ANSWERS TO YOUR MOST PRESSING
BUSINESS QUESTIONS, ALL
DELIVERED SECURELY AND
PRIVATELY. GETTING STARTED WITH
Q IS SIMPLE AND TAKES JUST THREE
STEPS. FIRST, YOU CONFIGURE
AMAZON Q BY CONNECTING AND
CUSTOMIZING Q WITH DETAILS OF
YOUR OWN ORGANIZATION. THEN Q
CONNECTS TO EXISTING DATA
SOURCES LIKE S3 SALESFORCE,
MICROSOFT, GOOGLE SLACK AND MORE
SUPPORTING OVER 40 POPULAR
BUSINESS APPLICATIONS AND
SERVICES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.
ONCE CONNECTED AMAZON Q STARTS
INDEXING ALL OF YOUR DATA AND
CONTENT, LEARNING EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR
BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES
UNDERSTANDING THE CORE CONCEPT
PRODUCT NAMES, ORGANIZATION,
STRUCTURE, ALL THE DETAILS THAT
MAKE YOUR BUSINESS UNIQUE, AS
WELL AS INDEXING THE DATA FROM
THESE SOURCES. Q ALSO USES
GENERATIVE AI TO UNDERSTAND AND
CAPTURE THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION
WHICH MAKES YOUR BUSINESS
UNIQUE. THIS ADDITIONAL SEMANTIC
INFORMATION IS CAPTURED AS
VECTOR EMBEDDINGS, ALLOWING Q TO
PROVIDE HIGHLY RELEVANT RESULTS
WHICH ARE TAILORED TO YOUR
SPECIFIC COMPANY AND INDUSTRY.
YOUR DATA REMAINS COMPLETELY
UNDER YOUR CONTROL AT ALL TIMES.
AMAZON Q NEVER SHARES IT
EXTERNALLY OR USES IT TO IMPROVE
ANY OF THE UNDERLYING MODELS,
AND THAT'S IT. SURPRISE. THERE
IS NO STEP THREE. JUST OPEN
AMAZON Q IN YOUR BROWSER AND
AWAY YOU GO WITH A FULLY
CUSTOMIZED, SECURE ASSISTANT WHO
IS AN EXPERT IN YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU COMMUNICATE WITH Q THROUGH
THIS FRIENDLY WEB APPLICATION
DESIGNED FOR EVERYONE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION TO USE. Q KNOWS WHO
YOU ARE AND ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY
AND ROLE. AND BECAUSE Q
UNDERSTANDS YOUR BUSINESS
SEMANTICS, YOU CAN ASK FAR MORE
DETAILED AND NUANCED QUESTIONS
AND GET TAILORED ANSWERS FASTER
THAN EVER BEFORE FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK Q TO ANALYZE WHICH
PRODUCT FEATURES CUSTOMERS ARE
STRUGGLING WITH AND RECOMMEND
WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM AS SOON AS
YOU HIT ENTER. Q GETS TO WORK ON
UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION AND
PREPARING AN ANSWER. Q STARTS BY
CREATING A SET OF INPUT PROMPTS.
AUTOMATIC ALI. Q THEN USES ALL
OF THE BUSINESS CONTEXT
AVAILABLE TO FIND RELEVANT DATA,
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS AND
PICKS THE BEST ONES BEFORE
COMBINING EVERYTHING TOGETHER
INTO A RESPONSE, ALL IN JUST A
FRACTION OF A SECOND, USING THE
POWER OF GENERATIVE AI AMAZON Q
REMAINS FAITHFUL TO YOUR
ORIGINAL SOURCES, CITING THEM IN
LINE SO THAT YOU CAN VALIDATE
THE INFORMATION EASILY. Q'S
EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE MAGICAL, BUT
THERE IS NO MAGICAL BLACK BOX
JUST GIVING YOU ANSWERS. YOU CAN
UPLOAD NEW WORD DOCUMENTS TO
CSVS AND OTHER FILES ON THE FLY.
GO TO Q TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS
RESPONSES, LETTING YOU ASK
QUESTIONS ABOUT AD HOC DATA
WHICH HASN'T YET BEEN ADDED TO
ANY CORPORATE SYSTEM. AND AMAZON
Q WAS BUILT WITH PRIVACY AND
SECURITY IN MIND FROM THE GROUND
UP. SO EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SEEK
INFORMATION TO WHICH WE DON'T
HAVE ACCESS, AMAZON Q RESPECTS
YOUR EXISTING ACCESS CONTROLS
ONLY RETURNING INFORMATION
YOU'RE AUTHORIZED TO SEE. ADMINS
CAN ALSO RESTRICT SENSITIVE
TOPICS FILTERING OUT
INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS AND
ANSWERS WHERE NECESSARY. FINALLY
AMAZON Q CAN TAKE ACTIONS ON
YOUR BEHALF THROUGH A SET OF
CONFIGURABLE PLUGINS? AS AN
EXAMPLE, IF YOU UPDATE, SAY,
YOUR TRAINING PRIORITIES, Q CAN
AUTOMATICALLY CREATE TICKETS IN
JIRA. NOTIFY LEADERS IN SLACK
AND UPDATE DASHBOARDS IN
SERVICENOW. Q ALLOWS YOU TO
INSPECT ACTIONS BEFORE THEY RUN
SO YOU CAN REVIEW THEM AND ADD
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND
AFTER THE ACTION RUNS, Q WILL
LINK TO THE RESULTS FOR
VERIFICATION. SO IN SUMMARY,
AMAZON Q BRINGS AI ASSISTANT
INTO THE BUSINESS WORLD,
PROVIDING SECURE TO RELEVANT AND
ACTIONABLE GUIDANCE TAILORED
ENTIRELY TO YOUR COMPANY. WE
CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO TRY. Q AND
SEE HOW IT WILL HELP YOUR
ORGANIZATION WITH THAT. BACK TO
ADAM. THANKS A LOT. THAT WAS
AWESOME. AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
BUSINESSES. EMPLOYEES ARE GOING
TO LOVE AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS AND DISCOVER
AND SYNTHESIZE NEW INFORMATION
AND LIFT FOLKS OUT OF MONOTONOUS
DRAG OF REPETITIVE TASKS. AND IT
IS GOING TO LOVE HOW ALL OF THIS
COMES WITH RIGOROUS SECURITY AND
PRIVACY. NOW, I KNOW AT LEAST A
FEW OF YOU OUT THERE ARE
WONDERING IF AMAZON Q CAN ACCESS
MY DATA? DOES THAT MEAN IT CAN
HELP WITH MY BUSINESS
INTELLIGENCE? YES. AND OF COURSE
THE ANDREW NG ANSWER IS A
RESOUNDING YES. SO WE'VE BEEN
WORKING FOR A WHILE TO MAKE
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE MORE
ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WITHOUT BI
EXPERTISE. WE THINK ANYONE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS
OF THEIR DATA USING NATURAL
LANGUAGE AND SO AMAZON
QUICKSIGHT OUR ML POWER BI
SERVICE NOW HAS AMAZON Q
FEATURES BUILT IN FIRST AMAZON Q
IS GOING TO HELP REDUCE THE TIME
THAT IT TAKES BUSINESS ANALYSTS
TO CREATE DASHBOARDS AND REPORTS
FROM HOURS DOWN TO MINUTES BY
LETTING THEM SIMPLY TELL AMAZON
Q WHAT THEY WANT TO VISUALIZE.
FOR EXAMPLE, REGIONAL SALES BY
PRODUCT IS A SANKEY DIAGRAM. Q
COMES RIGHT BACK WITH THAT
DIAGRAM. UM, AND YOU CAN ADD IT
TO YOUR DASHBOARD WITH EASE AND
YOU CAN TELL. Q TO FURTHER
REFINE THE VISUAL, SAY YOU WANT
TO CHANGE THE CHART TO A
VERTICAL STACKED BAR CHART BY
MONTH AND COLOR CODED BY REGION.
YOUR WISH IS Q'S COMMAND. WITH
Q, YOU CAN GET BETTER DASHBOARDS
FASTER, BUT EVEN THE BEST
DASHBOARDS DON'T TELL EVERY
ANGLE OF THE STORY. FOR, FOR
EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ASK AMAZON. Q
WHERE DID WE HAVE THE HIGHEST
SALES? AND YOU GET A GET A
RESPONSE CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR
BUSINESS DATA. YOU CAN ASK A
FOLLOW UP QUESTION EVEN AS
LITTLE AS ONE WORD LIKE LONDON.
AND BECAUSE Q MAINTAINS THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR CURRENT
CONVERSATIONS, YOU CAN GET
INSIGHTS FROM YOUR DATA QUICKLY.
ORI NOW ENABLING PEOPLE TO TALK
TO Q AND QUICKSIGHT IS A BIG
STEP FORWARD IN HELPING YOUR
ORGANIZATION BE EVEN MORE DATA
DRIVEN. BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
GETTING HANDS ON WITH DATA. A
LOT OF PEOPLE CONSUME DATA
THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AND
REPORTS, AND SO, SO MUCH OF YOU
DO AT WORK IS TELLING STORIES
WITH DATA. AND AS YOUR BUSINESS
EXPERT, Q IS HERE TO MAKE THAT
EASIER TOO. LET'S SAY YOU WANT
TO CREATE A MONTHLY REPORT ON
YOUR BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA.
YOU CAN ASK YOU TO WRITE A
MONTHLY REPORT ABOUT THE
BUSINESS AND MAKE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT MONTH.
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU
VISUALIZATION OPTIONS. YOU
CHOOSE THE ONES YOU WANT, AND
THEN Q WILL FORMAT THEM. AND IN
SECONDS YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL AND
COMPELLING STORY AND IT'S
COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE. YOU CAN
ACTUALLY ADD MORE CONTEXT TO THE
SECTION BY ASKING YOU TO ADD A
VISUAL OF THE USAGE TREND, AND Q
WILL GENERATE A SHORT SUMMARY.
AND THEN YOU CAN FURTHER TWEAK
IT BY MAKING IT LONGER, SHORTER
OR REFORMATTING IT TO BULLETS.
LET'S MAKE IT LONGER. ONCE WE'RE
HAPPY WITH THE STORY, WE CAN
SECURELY SHARE IT WITH OTHERS.
WITH AMAZON Q AND QUICKSIGHT YOU
NOW HAVE AN EXPERT BI ASSISTANT
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR BUSINESS ANALYSTS AND IT'S
GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR END
USERS TO GET ANSWERS TO AND
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND THESE NEW Q
CAPABILITIES AND QUICKSIGHT ARE
AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW TODAY. NOW,
A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE
TARGETED TO HORIZONTAL USE CASES
OR SPECIFIC LINES OF BUSINESS
AND AWS HAS APPLICATIONS IN
THESE AREAS TOO. SO OUR FIRST
SPECIALIZED LINE OF BUSINESS
SOLUTION WAS AMAZON CONNECT. SO
IT'S BORN IN THE CLOUD AND OF
COURSE, AMAZON CONNECT IS A
SCALABLE COST EFFECTIVE, EASY TO
USE. CONTACT CENTER APPLICATION
THAT'S REINVENTED CUSTOMER
SERVICE GENERATIVE AI THAT KNOWS
YOUR BUSINESS IS GOING TO HAVE
AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON THE
WHOLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
EXPERIENCE ACROSS SO MANY
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. YOUR
CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAMS ARE AT
THE HEART OF YOUR BUSINESSES
DELIVERING INTERACTIONS THAT
PEOPLE REMEMBER FOR GOOD AND FOR
BAD. SO GETTING THIS RIGHT
REALLY MATTERS IS TODAY CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS SPEND A LOT OF
TIME GATHERING INFORMATION FROM
CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR
QUESTIONS AND THEN THEY SPEND
EVEN MORE TIME SEARCHING FOR THE
RIGHT ANSWER. NOW CONNECT HAS
MADE THIS A LOT EASIER ALREADY
WITH MACHINE LEARNING
TRANSCRIPTION ANALYTICS, BUT WE
KNEW WE COULD MAKE IT EVEN
BETTER FOR YOUR AGENTS AND
CERTAINLY FOR THE CUSTOMERS
WAITING ON THE OTHER END OF THE
LINE FOR HELP. ENTER AMAZON Q
AND CONNECT AVAILABLE TODAY AND
THIS IS GOING TO GIVE CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS A MAJOR ASSIST
AGENTS CAN CHAT WITH. Q DIRECTLY
INSIDE OF AMAZON CONNECT TO HELP
THEM RESPOND QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS. LIVE CHAT WITH Q WITH
FAST ANSWERS IS GREAT, BUT WHAT
IF YOU COULD MAKE THE CALL
ITSELF THE PROMPT NOW INSIDE OF
CONNECT? Q IS ACTUALLY THERE ON
THE CALLS ASSISTING WITH
PROPOSED RESPONSES WITH
SUGGESTED ACTIONS, WITH LINKS TO
RELEVANT ARTICLES? NO TYPING
REQUIRED, SO CONTACT CENTERS,
SUPERVISORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
ARE ALSO GOING TO GET A
GENERATIVE AI BOOST CONNECT NOW
AUTOMATICALLY CREATES POST CALL
SUMMARIES THAT SUPERVISORS CAN
USE TO TRACK FOLLOW UP ACTIONS
AND TO UNCOVER AGENT COACHING
OPPORTUNITIES. AND FOR
ADMINISTRATORS, CONNECT CAN SET
UP CHAT BOTS AND INTERACTIVE
VOICE RESPONSES THROUGH SIMPLE
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPTS.
STREAMLINE LEARNING THE PROCESS.
AMAZON Q IS JUST THE FIRST OF
MANY SPECIALIZED INDUSTRY AND
USE CASE SPECIFIC SERVICES THAT
ARE GOING TO SUPERCHARGE AMAZON
Q SO STAY TUNED. AMAZON
CODEBUILD AMAZON Q BUILDER, YOUR
AWS EXPERT, AWS Q BUSINESS, YOUR
BUSINESS EXPERT AT AMAZON, Q AND
QUICKSIGHT YOUR BUSINESS

THAT CAN BE ENRICHED WITH THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR BUSINESS. AND
IT'S ALL ON AWS BUILT WITH OUR
HIGH BAR THAT GIVES YOU BROAD
AND DEEP CAPABILITIES, CHOICE
AND ENTERPRISE READINESS. BUT
IT'S SO EARLY IN THE GAME AND
WE'RE INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
DO TOGETHER. NOW, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING THAT CUSTOMERS ARE
GOING TO NEED FOR ANY OF THIS TO
WORK, AND THAT'S DATA. YOUR
DATA. NO ONE ELSE HAS IT. NO ONE
ELSE CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU CAN
. YOUR DATA IS KEY TO SETTING
YOUR ORGANIZATION APART FROM THE
PACK. AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED,
GENERATIVE AI HAS JUST MADE IT
SO MUCH MORE RELEVANT AND
IMPACTFUL WHEN YOU TAILOR YOUR
DATA. SO LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM A
LONG TIME CUSTOMER ABOUT HOW
THEY'RE USING DATA TO CREATE
FIRST CLASS EXPERIENCES FOR
THEIR CUSTOMERS. SO PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE, STEPHANE
DURACH, VP OF CONNECTED COMPANY
AT BMW.
THANK YOU. HELLO EVERYONE. IT'S
FANTASTIC TO BE HERE. I COULDN'T
AGREE MORE DATA IS KEY. THE
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCT COMPLEXITY IS
STRONGLY INCREASED. KING AND
DEVELOPMENT SPEED IS ESSENTIAL.
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW BMW IS
MASTERING DATA ACCELERATING THE
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND
DELIVERING BEST IN CLASS
EXPERIENCE TO OUR CUSTOMER
ANYWHERE. AND ANYTIME ACROSS THE
ENTIRE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO FROM
BMW TO MINI AND EVEN ROLLS-ROYCE
, BMW IS PROVIDING GAME CHANGING
VEHICLE ENTERTAINMENT AND
EXPERIENCE POWERED BY AWS. WE
OPTIMIZE OUR TECH STACK, IMPROVE
OUR WORKFLOW AND USE DATA BY
LEVERAGING AWS CLOUD TECHNOLOGY.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES.
CLOUD DATA, BMW CENTRAL DATA
LAKE BUILT BY BMW AND AWS HOSTED
DATA FROM OUR CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET AND BY UPLOADING UPHOLDING
THE STRICTEST DATA PRIVACY
STANDARDS ON TOP OF IT, TEAMS
CAN BUILD THEIR APPLICATION AND
MODEL AS WELL AS DEPLOY UPDATES
AND IMPROVEMENTS TOGETHER. WE
ARE EXPLORING INNOVATIVE USE OF
MACHINE LEARNING, INCLUDING
AMAZON SAGEMAKER. THIS AUTOMATED
DRIVING PLATFORM IS BY BMW IS
BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF
DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEM ON
AWS. THIS AUTOMATED DRIVING
PLATFORM IS CAPABLE TO HANDLE
SEVERAL HUNDRED PETABYTE OF DATA
FROM OUR GLOBAL TEST FLEET. WE
ARE ACCELERATE TESTING OUR
DEVELOPMENT, SIMULATING AND
VALIDATION PROCESS DRAMATICALLY
FOR OUR PRODUCT LAUNCH IN 2025
WITH OUR ROUTE OPTIMIZED
CHARGING SERVICES, WE ARE
PROVIDING REAL TIME TRAFFIC
CALCULATION BASED ON DRIVING
STYLE PREFERENCE TRAFFIC OR
AVAILABLE CHARGING STATIONS AND
MANY MORE. WE ALSO USE AMAZON
TECHNOLOGY LIKE ALEXA FOR OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
AND FIRE TV TO CREATE UNIQUE
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, INSIGHT,
THE VEHICLE, OUR CONNECTED
VEHICLE AI PLATFORM IS BUILT ON
AWS AND FORMED THE BACKBONE OF
THE LARGEST CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET WHERE DE FOR SOME MORE
EVEN EYE OPENING STATS, LET'S
DIVE IN. 20 YEARS AGO BMW
INTRODUCED ITS FIRST VEHICLE
CONNECTED VEHICLE AND WE COME
QUITE A LONG WAY SINCE THEN. AND
NOW THE BMW GROUP HAS THE
LARGEST CONNECTED FLEET WITH
MORE THAN 20 MILLION VEHICLES
GLOBALLY OVER THE LAST THREE
YEARS. WE MIGRATED THE CONNECTED
VEHICLE BACKEND TO AWS BY
UTILIZING THE GLOBAL PRESENCE OF
AWS IN MANY REGIONS WORLDWIDE.
WE ARE UPDATE ADDING MORE THAN 6
MILLION VEHICLES OVER THE AIR ON
A REGULAR BASIS. THE THOSE
NUMBERS ARE GROWING CONSTANTLY.
IT REQUIRES TO MANAGE MORE THAN
12 BILLION REQUESTS PER DAY WITH
OVER 1000 DIFFERENT
MICROSERVICES. ULTIMATELY, WE
ARE PROCESSING MORE THAN 110TB
OF DATA TRAFFIC PER DAY WITH A
REMARKABLE RELIABILITY. LOOK AT
THESE NUMBERS. I'M ALWAYS
IMPRESSED, HOWEVER, WITH OUR NEW
PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE. THIS
NUMBER WILL TRIPLE IN THE NEXT
TWO YEARS. LET'S CHANGE
PERSPECTIVE AND TAKE A LOOK AT A
COUPLE OF NUMBERS IN THE
DEVELOPMENT PHASE. MORE THAN
8500 SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
WORLDWIDE CREATE FIRST CLASS
CODE FOR OUR VEHICLE AND
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE BMW SERIES
RUN SEVEN SERIES RUNS ON OVER
500 MILLION LINES OF CODE. OUR
WORLDWIDE DEV OPS TEAMS EXECUTE
MORE THAN 110 SOFTWARE, BUILDS
EVERY DAY BY USING MORE THAN
60,000 VIRTUAL CPUS TO KEEP UP
WITH OUR DEMAND. WE USE AWS
SERVICES TO SCALE UP AND
ACCELERATE DEVELOPMENT WHENEVER
IT IS NECESSARY. LET'S TAKE A
DEEPER LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT.
TRADITIONALLY, BMW'S COMES FROM
A HARDWARE DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
AND EVERY DEVELOPER HAD TO DO
THE DEVELOPMENT WORK ON A
PHYSICAL TEST TRACK. TODAY WE
ARE USING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY
TO STREAMLINE OUR INFOTAINMENT
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE NEW
APPROACH ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE
TEST FUNCTIONALITIES REMOTELY TO
OUR GLOBAL DEVELOPER TEAMS. AN
EXAMPLE IS USING AMAZON EC2 FOR
VIRTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE
CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COLLABORATION.
OUR NEXT STEP IS TO EXTEND THIS
APPROACH TO BUILD A FULLY
VIRTUAL DIGITAL TWIN. NOW LET'S
TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND SOME
EXCITING FEATURES WE CREATED FOR
OUR MINI CUSTOMERS. ON THE
PICTURE, YOU CAN SEE THE MINI
INTERIOR. IT'S OUR WAY TO
EMPHASIZE BRAND TYPICAL DESIGN.
TAKE THE IMPRESSIVE ROUND ALI
DISPLAY IN OUR NEW MINI FAMILY.
AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, OUR SPEECH
IS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE DOMINANT
MODALITY FOR INTERACTING WITH
VEHICLES. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY
INTEGRATING ALEXA VOICE
ASSISTANT. HOWEVER, THIS YEAR WE
ARE RAISING THE BAR. WE WILL USE
ALEXA TECHNOLOGY TO BRING OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL. NOW LET'S
TAKE A SEAT IN THE BACK OF OUR
SEVEN SERIES. ONE OF OUR MOST
EXCITING FEATURE IS THE BMW
THEATER SCREEN. IT'S THE 30 INCH
SCREEN WITH AN EIGHT K
RESOLUTION. IT IS SPECTACULAR,
INTEGRATED IN THE CAR. IT GIVES
YOU A REAL CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE
WITH FIRE TV. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN
SEAMLESSLY ENJOY THEIR FAVORITE
SERIES AND MOVIES. IT'S OUR
STRONG COLLABORATION WITH AWS
AND AMAZON THAT UNLOCKS NEW
POSSIBILITIES, ENABLE US TO
THINK ABOUT THE CAR IN A NEW
DIMENSION. SO ONE LAST THING TO
GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE INTO THE
FUTURE. THIS IS THE BMW NEW
CLASS. THIS WILL LAUNCH IN 2025.
BMW HAS BEEN ALWAYS ON THE
FOREFRONT OF AUTOMOTIVE
INNOVATION. THE NEW CLASS WILL
BE A QUANTUM LEAP IN CUSTOMER
EXPERIENCE. IT WILL TAKE THE
DRIVING EXPERIENCE TO A NEW
LEVEL AS YOU CAN SEE, THE NEW
CLASS INTRODUCED A COMPLETELY
NEW INTERIOR WITH THE BMW
PANORAMIC VISION. WE DEVELOPED A
NEW HEAD UP DISPLAY TO PROJECT
INFORMATION PILLAR TO PILLAR,
AND FOR THE PERFECT DRIVER
ORIENTATION AND USER EXPERIENCE.
ALL OF THIS EMPHASIZES IMPROVE.
BMW IS MASTERING DATA
ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT
PROCESS AND DELIVERING THE BEST
IN CLASS EXPERIENCE TO THE
CUSTOMER ANYWHERE AND ANYTIME
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EXCITING AND
ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT
NOW. AWS AND THE BMW GROUP ARE
WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER TO
SHAPE THIS FUTURE. THANK YOU
ALL. GOODBYE AND I'LL SEE YOU
SOON. FOR AN INCREDIBLE DATA
PLATFORM YOU'VE BUILT AND THE
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE IT'S
CREATING FOR YOUR CONSUMERS.
JUST AMAZING. THANK YOU, STEFAN.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU, AS
ALWAYS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO
AS STEFAN HAS JUST MADE SO
CLEAR, SUCCESS WITH AI AS WELL
AS WITH NEARLY EVERY OTHER
BUSINESS PRIORITY RELIES ON
HAVING A STRONG DATA STRATEGY.
AND ONE QUESTION I HEAR FROM
CUSTOMERS FREQUENTLY IS HOW
SHOULD I THINK ABOUT DATA IN A
GENERATIVE AI WORLD? WELL, THE
ANSWER IS THAT FOR GENERATIVE
AI, YOUR DATA IS YOUR
DIFFERENTIATOR. NOW WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT CUSTOMIZATION THROUGH
BEDROCK CODEWHISPERER
CUSTOMIZATIONS, AMAZON TAILORED
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND EXAMPLES
FROM DELTA AIRLINES AND PFIZER
ALL TAL ADDING CONTEXT TO YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA IS ABSOLUTELY
CRITICAL TO PROVIDING VALUE.
NOW, IN EACH OF THESE EXAMPLES,
ALS, THE DATA USED TO CUSTOMIZE
THE APPLICATION HAS TO BE UP TO
DATE. IT HAD TO BE COMPLETE AND
ACCURATE. IT HAD TO BE
DISCOVERABLE AND IT HAD TO BE
AVAILABLE WHEN YOU NEEDED IT. SO
THE FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING ALL
OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE YOUR
DATA IS IN THE CLOUD. NOW,
GENERATIVE AI IS JUST ONE OF
MANY REASONS THAT YOU WANT THIS.
HAVING EFFECTIVE CLOUD BASED
DATA STRATEGY IS GOING TO
INCREASE YOUR INSIGHT. IT'S
GOING TO REDUCE YOUR COST AND
IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE
INNOVATION. NOW, TO UNDERSTAND
THIS, JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MANY
DIFFERENT ISSUES THERE ARE TO
CONSIDER WHEN TRYING TO MAKE THE
MOST OF YOUR DATA. ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA. IT
COMES FROM DIFFERENT ORIGINS,
AND IT COMES AT VARIOUS SCALES
AND SPEEDS AS DIFFERENT TEAMS
ALL ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION ARE
GOING TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT
DATA IN MANY, MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF WAYS. AND THEN HOW YOU
WANT TO USE THIS DATA IS JUST AS
VARIED. YOUR STORING IT, YOUR
POWERING, YOUR APPLICATIONS,
YOUR ANALYZING IT, YOU'RE
GENERATING PREDICTIONS FROM IT.
THERE'S NO ONE TOOL OR SOLUTION
THAT CAN DO IT ALL UNLESS YOU'RE
WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES LIKE
PERFORMANCE COST OR
CAPABILITIES. BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE THOSE SACRIFICE CHOICES.
SO WHAT YOU NEED IS A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF TOOLS THAT
ACCOUNTS FOR THE SCALE AND THE
VARIETY OF THIS DATA AND THE
MANY, MANY PURPOSES FOR WHICH
YOU WANT TO USE IT. YOU NEED TO
INTEGRATE IT AND COMBINE ALL
THAT DATA THAT'S SPREAD ALL OVER
TO CREATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND PREDICT
WHAT WILL HAPPEN. AND OF COURSE,
YOU NEED GOVERNANCE SO THAT YOU
CAN HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE OF
ACCESS AND CONTROL EVERY STEP OF
THE WAY. YOU NEED IT ALL. IF YOU
MISS EVEN ONE ASPECT, YOUR
ABILITY TO USE THAT DATA IS
SIGNIFICANTLY HOBBLED. SO IN
ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN
STORE, ANALYZE AND PROCESS THE
DATA YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF DATA
SERVICES SO YOU CAN GET THE
PRICE PERFORMANCE, YOU CAN GET
THE SPEED, THE FLEXIBILITY AND
THE CAPABILITIES FOR YOUR USE
CASE. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
BUILT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SET
OF CLOUD DATA SERVICES OUT THERE
. SO TO START, WE HAVE AMAZON S3
AND CUSTOMERS USE S3 TO MAKE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DATA
LAKES WHERE THEY CAN BRING
STRUCTURED DATA TOGETHER WITH
UNSTRUCTURED DATA AND MAKE IT
ALL AVAILABLE FOR ANALYTICS AND
MACHINE LEARNING. WE ALSO OFFER
EIGHT RELATIONAL DATABASES,
INCLUDING AMAZON, AURORA THE
RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICE
THAT'S BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP
FOR THE CLOUD AND IS STILL THE
FASTEST GROWING SERVICE IN AWS
HISTORY. WE ALSO HAVE EIGHT
PURPOSE BUILT DATABASES, NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES, INCLUDING
AMAZON DYNAMODB, WHICH IS USED
BY OVER A MILLION DEVELOPERS
SORRY, A MILLION CUSTOMERS FOR
ITS SERVERLESS SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND PERFORMANCE AT ANY
SCALE. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE
BROADEST AND DEEPEST SET OF
ANALYTICS SERVICES AND THIS
INCLUDES OUR DATA WAREHOUSE
SERVICE, AMAZON REDSHIFT, WHICH
DELIVERS UP TO SIX OR EVEN SEVEN
TIMES BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
DEPENDING ON YOUR WORKLOAD THAN
OTHER CLOUD DATA WAREHOUSES.
WE'VE GOT AMAZON EMR TO EASILY
RUN SPARK AND OTHER BIG DATA
WORKLOADS AND AMAZON OPENSEARCH
SERVICE WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF ACTIVE CUSTOMERS AND HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF CLUSTERS UNDER
MANAGEMENT. AND THAT ALL
PROCESSES TRILLIONS OF REQUESTS
PER MONTH AND MANY, MANY, MANY
MORE ANALYTIC SERVICES. I WON'T
GO THROUGH THEM ALL, BUT YOU
NEED THIS BREADTH AND THIS DEPTH
OF CHOICE SO THAT YOU CAN NEVER
HAVE TO COMPROMISE ON COST, ON
PERFORMANCE OR ON SCALE, AND
INSTEAD YOU CAN CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOL FOR THE JOB. NOW, WE'VE
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT AI AND ML
EXTENSIVELY, SO I'M NOT GOING TO
DWELL ON THAT HERE. BUT YOU NEED
TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOLS TO FEED YOUR AI AND
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'RE
DOING IN YOUR BUSINESS. AND THE
SECOND THING THAT YOU NEED AS
YOU MOVE TO PUT DATA AT THE
CENTER OF YOUR BUSINESS IS TO
BREAK DOWN YOUR DATA SILOS. MOST
PEOPLE HAVE DATA SPREAD OUT ALL
OVER THE ORGANIZATION IN
DATABASES, ANALYTIC TOOLS, SAAS
APPLICATIONS, SPREADSHEETS AND
MORE. AND TO GET THE MOST VALUE
FROM YOUR DATA, YOU NEED TO BE
ABLE TO USE IT ALL. NO MATTER
WHERE IT LIVES. AND TO DO THIS
TODAY, MOST PEOPLE MOVE DATA
AROUND OR TRY TO CONNECT THE
VARIOUS SILOS USING A PROCESS
CALLED ETL OR EXTRACT, TRANSFORM
AND LOAD. YEAH, I SEE SOME OF
YOU FLINCHED WHEN I SAID THAT
BECAUSE YOU KNOW. RIGHT. YOU
KNOW EXACTLY HOW BAD THIS
PROCESS CAN BE. IT IS TEARING
ALL FIRST DEVELOPERS HAVE TO
DESIGN AN ETL PIPELINE
ARCHITECTURE. THEY HAVE TO
DECIDE WHERE TO EXTRACT THE DATA
FROM, AND IT'S OFTEN COMING FROM
MULTIPLE SOURCES. THEN THEY HAVE
TO WRITE CODE TO TRANSFORM THE
DATA AND REMOVE DUPLICATES. THEY
HAVE TO FILTER OUT OUTLIERS,
RETRIEVE MISSING DATA AND
IDENTIFY CORRUPTED DATA. AFTER
ALL THAT, YOU HAVE TO TRANSFORM.
YOU HAVE TO LOAD YOUR TRANSFORM
DATA TO ITS NEW DESTINATION,
WHICH ONCE AGAIN MEANS MORE CODE
TO WRITE. THEN, IF SOMETHING
CHANGES, LIKE A DATA ENGINEER
SWAPPING OUT A DATA TABLE OR
ADDING A NEW FIELD, YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK AGAIN AND UPDATE ALL OF
YOUR CODE ONCE MORE. IT IS
MONOTONOUS, IT IS TEDIOUS AND IT
IS JUST A WHOLE LOT OF UNFUN
WORK, WHICH IS WHY WE INTRODUCED
OUR VISION OF A ZERO ETL FUTURE
FOR AND IN THIS FUTURE YOU CAN
WAVE GOODBYE TO THE BORING,
FRUSTRATING PROCESS OF ETL. YOUR
DATA IS AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTED
FROM THE SOURCE TO THE
DESTINATION. IT'S THAT EASY AND
YOU GET YOUR DATA WHERE YOU NEED
IT WHEN YOU NEED IT. NO MORE
BUILDING AND MANAGING COMPLEX,
BRITTLE PROCESSES AND PIPELINES.
IT'S REALLY EXCITING. BUT IS IT
REAL? WELL, IS IT DOWN PAYMENT?
LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED A FULLY
MANAGED ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
BETWEEN AURORA, MYSQL AND
REDSHIFT. WITHIN SECONDS OF DATA
BEING WRITTEN INTO AURORA, YOU
CAN USE REDSHIFT TO DO NEAR REAL
TIME ANALYTICS AND ON PETABYTES
OF DATA. YOU CAN ENABLE THIS
INTEGRATION WITH JUST A FEW
CLICKS AND ZERO-ETL. IT IS
INCREDIBLY EASY NOW THIS FIRST
ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IS READY,
IS READY DONE. BUT WE'VE WE'VE
WE WANT TO DELIVER SO MUCH MORE.
AND SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TODAY
TO BE ANNOUNCING THREE MORE ZERO
ETL INTEGRATIONS WITH REDSHIFT.
LET'S GET THEM ALL DONE AT ONCE.
AURORA POSTGRES RDS FOR MYSQL
AND DYNAMODB. THESE ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS AND AMAZON REDSHIFT
ARE ALL AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW
WHEN TODAY. SO. SO THAT MAKES.
YEAH. YOU DON'T LIKE THE MUCK,
DO YOU? SO THAT'S FOUR OF OUR
MOST POPULAR RELATIONAL AND NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES TOGETHER
WITH THE DATA WAREHOUSE THAT
GIVES YOU THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITHOUT ANY OF THE
ETL FANTASTIC. BUT REMEMBER,
WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THIS VISION.
SO OF COURSE OUR NEXT QUESTION
WAS, WELL, WHERE ELSE COULD WE
BE REMOVING THE PAIN OF ETL?
NOW, MANY OF YOU NEED TO USE
SEARCH ON YOUR TRANSACTIONAL
DATA TO ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE
OF YOUR APPLICATION. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE AN
E-COMMERCE APPLICATION AND YOU
WANT TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED
RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOUR USER,
YOU USE SIMILARITY SEARCH ON
TRANSACTION DATA. THAT'S GOING
TO BE STORED IN YOUR DATABASE.
SO TO DO THIS CURRENTLY YOU'RE
DESIGNING, YOU'RE BUILDING,
YOU'RE MANAGING COMPLEX DATA
PIPELINE ARCHITECTURES FROM YOUR
DATABASE TO A SEARCH ENGINE. AND
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOU ARE
BUILDING THOSE PIPELINES TO
AMAZON OPENSEARCH SERVICE FOR
ITS POWERFUL SEARCH CAPABILITIES
. I BET YOU CAN TELL WHERE WE'RE
GOING WITH THIS. SO TODAY I'M
REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE UNVEILED
ONE MORE ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IN
DYNAMO. DB ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
WITH OPENSEARCH SERVICE
GENERALLY AVAILABLE TODAY. AND
THIS NEW INTEGRATION MAKES IT SO
EASY TO SEARCH DYNAMODB DATA
WITH OUR OPENSEARCH SERVICE. AND
IT'S JUST THE FIRST OF THESE
DATABASE INTEGRATIONS TO OUR
OPENSEARCH SERVICE THAT'S GOING
TO HELP YOU DO MORE WITH DATA.
SO OUR NEW ZERO-ETL INTEGRATIONS
ARE BRINGING TRANSACTIONAL DATA
AND ANALYTICS TOGETHER FASTER
AND MORE EASILY AND CUSTOMERS
ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE
IDEA OF A ZERO-ETL FUTURE. SO
YOU CAN BE CERTAIN WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP INNOVATING HERE. NOW
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE
TOOLS THAT YOU NEED AND HOW YOU
CAN HAVE DATA WHERE YOU NEED IT
WITHOUT THE PAINFUL ETL BURDEN.
NEXT YOU WANT TO EMPOWER PEOPLE
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION TO USE
YOUR DATA TO ITS FULLEST AND YOU
WANT THEM WALLOWING IN YOUR
DATA, EXPERIMENTING, ASKING
QUESTIONS, SPARKING IDEAS. AND
YOU WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS.
BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM YOUR
DATA IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE, SO
YOU WANT TO GRANT ACCESS ONLY TO
THE RIGHT EMPLOYEES AT THE RIGHT
TIME. YOU NEED TO KEEP IT SAFE
AND SECURE. SO YOU ALSO NEED
CONTROL, YOUR ACCESS CONTROL.
KOHL THESE ARE OPPOSITES, RIGHT?
NO, YOU CAN HAVE IN FACT, YOU
MUST HAVE BOTH AND THE KEY TO
MAKING SURE THAT YOUR DATA IS,
IS SAFE, IS GOVERNED, HAS ACCESS
, IS GOVERNANCE CREATING
VISIBILITY INTO YOUR DATA AND
CONTROLLING WHO CAN ACCESS YOUR
DATA AND WHEN THEY CAN ACCESS IT
WITH ROBUST GOVERNANCE, YOU'RE
GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO
THE DATA THEY NEED AND ONLY THAT
DATA. AND WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT
DATA YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW WHERE IT
IS. YOU HAVE GUARDRAILS AND
TOOLS IN PLACE TO SAFELY UNLOCK
IT. THAT BUILDS CONFIDENCE. AND
THEN PEOPLE WITHIN THE
ORGANIZATION DEVELOP TRUST IN
THE DATA. YOU ACTUALLY EMPOWER
INNOVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION
RATHER THAN STIFLING IT. AND SO
TO HELP YOU WITH GOVERNANCE, WE
DEVELOPED AMAZON DATAZONE DATA
ZONES, A DATA MANAGEMENT SERVICE
THAT HELPS YOU CATALOG,
DISCOVER, SHARE AND GOVERN DATA
ACROSS YOUR ORGANIZATION. WE'RE
GETTING GREAT FEEDBACK FROM LOTS
OF DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
LEADER IN BRAZIL, ITAU. AND
WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE
IMPACT THAT DATA ZONE IS HAVING
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY IN THIS SPACE.
TODAY, DATA ZONE USES MACHINE
LEARNING TO AUTOMATICALLY ADD
METADATA TO YOUR CATALOG, BUT IN
ORDER TO FIND THE RIGHT DATA AT
THE RIGHT TIME, CUSTOMERS STILL
HAVE TO CHOOSE TO ADD BUSINESS
CONTEXT LIKE EXPLAINING THE
DATA'S PURPOSE OR CLARIFYING THE
COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS. AND NOW
THIS HELPS EMPLOYEES FIND THE
DATA THAT THEY NEED. IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
KNOW THE DATA EXISTS, THE
QUESTION OF ACCESS AND CONTROL
BECOMES MOOT. BUT ADDING ALL
THIS DATA IS A METADATA IS
TEDIOUS. IT'S A MANUAL PROCESS.
WELL, NO LONGER. WE'RE MAKING
YOUR CATALOGING EVEN SMARTER.
AND TODAY I'M REALLY PLEASED TO
ANNOUNCE A NEW CAPABILITY THAT
AUTOMATICALLY SUGGESTS BUSINESS
DESCRIPTIONS TO ADD CONTEXT FOR
YOUR DATA SET IN JUST A FEW
CLICKS, CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS
SIMPLY CHOOSE A DATA SET AND
DATAZONE WILL USE GENERATIVE AI
TO CREATE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS
FOR YOUR DATA. USING OUR TRAINED
MODELS. MAKING IT EASIER TO
UNDERSTAND THESE DESCRIPTIONS
CAN BE REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED, OR
EVEN FURTHER CLARIFIED OR EDITED
FOR YOUR EXACT PREFERENCES. DATA
ZONES ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO USE
YOUR DATA. THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE
TIME SAVER IN THIS CAPABILITY IS
GOING TO HELP EMPLOYEES TO FIND
THE RIGHT DATA FOR EVEN FASTER
INSIGHTS. WE'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE TO HELP YOU
USE DATA GOVERNANCE TO SET YOUR
DATA FREE. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
DO IN YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED AN
END TO END DATA STRATEGY THAT
PROVIDES CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE
ENTIRE SPAN OF YOUR DATA NEEDS.
YOU NEED TO EASILY CONNECT DATA
ACROSS SILOS AND YOU NEED YOU
NEED YOUR DATA TO BE GOVERNED TO
BE CONFIDENT THAT THE RIGHT DATA
IS USED IN THE RIGHT WAYS BY
ONLY THE RIGHT PEOPLE. WE'RE
MAKING AWS THE BEST PLACE FOR
ALL OF YOUR DATA NEEDS ACROSS
ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS.
AND WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS AND
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO MAKE DATA,
YOUR DIFFERENTIATOR IN AI AND
ACROSS YOUR BUSINESS, IT'S
AMAZING. WE'VE TALKED A LOT
ABOUT REINVENTION TODAY AND HERE
AT AWS THE MOST IMPORTANT
REINVENTION OF ALL IS YOURS TO
SUPPORT YOU IN ALL THE WAYS THAT
YOU WANT TO ADAPT AND EVOLVE. WE
CONTINUOUSLY CONTINUE TO
CHALLENGE OURSELVES. WE TRY AND
THINK DIFFERENTLY. WE TRY AND
GIVE YOU THE CAPABILITY WIZ THAT
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED, AND EVEN
SOME MAYBE THAT YOU'VE NEVER
IMAGINED. NOW, THIS ISN'T THE
WORK OF A FEW MONTHS OR EVEN A
YEAR, BUT WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT.
WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE AT
AMAZON WE MAKE BOLD BETS. SO
THIRD PARTY SELLING ON AMAZON
PRIME, EVEN AWS ITSELF IS A BIG
BET. I MEAN, IT TOOK A LOT OF
YEARS AND A LOT OF CAPITAL TO
BUILD OUT THE ON DEMAND
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES THAT
SIMPLY BECAME KNOWN AS THE CLOUD
FOR THIS LONG TERM FOCUS IS A
GOOD THING. BEING WILLING TO
THINK DIFFERENTLY AND LONG TERM
IS A GOOD THING. IT'S THE ONLY
PREDICTABLE WAY TO PROFOUNDLY
CHANGE WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR
CUSTOMERS. AWS. NOW THERE'S
ANOTHER BIG BET THAT AMAZON IS
MAKING YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF
PROJECT KUIPER AND YEAH, KUIPER.
KUIPER'S BUILDING A
CONSTELLATION OF THOUSANDS OF
LOW EARTH ORBIT SATELLITES. WHY?
WELL, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE ON EARTH LACK FAST OR
RELIABLE OR EVEN ANY INTERNET
ACCESS. PROJECT KUIPER IS GOING
TO HELP CLOSE THAT DIGITAL
DIGITAL DIVIDE BY DELIVERING
FAST, AFFORDABLE BROADBAND TO A
WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS
OPERATING IN PLACES WITHOUT
RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTIONS.
IN FACT, JUST LAST MONTH, KUIPER
, THE KUIPER TEAM SUCCESSFULLY
LAUNCHED ITS FIRST TWO PROTOSTAR
SATELLITES INTO ORBIT. IT'S JUST
INCREDIBLE THING. I MEAN, THEY
PUT SATELLITES UP THERE. THEY'RE
WORKING FLAWLESSLY. EVERYBODY'S
REALLY HAPPY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED
THERE RIGHT? WOW I MEAN, KUIPER
IS A GLOBAL HIGH SPEED SATELLITE
NETWORK THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE
COVERAGE IN PLACES THAT HAVE
NEVER HAD COVERAGE BEFORE. I
MEAN, IMAGINE THE POWER OF
DELIVERING A REALLY HARD TO
REACH PLACES, THE ABILITY TO
ACCESS THE INTERNET WITH THE
SAME SPEED. THE SAME RELIABILITY
THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED
EVERY DAY. NOW, THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR CONSUMERS IS,
FOR SURE, ENORMOUS. BUT SO ARE
THE BENEFITS TO BUSINESSES AND
GOVERNMENTS. AND THERE ARE ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES LIKE
RENEWABLE ENERGY PROVIDERS THAT
WANT TO ANALYZE IN REAL TIME
DATA FROM OFF SHORE WIND FARMS
OR FIRST RESPONDERS WHO NEED
FAST, RELIABLE CONNECTIONS
DURING NATURAL DISASTERS OR
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LOOKING
FOR CONNECTIVITY, BACKUP IN CASE
OF AN UNPLANNED OUTAGE. KUIPER
IS GOING TO HELP TO MAKE ALL OF
THIS POSSIBLE AND AWS CUSTOMERS
ARE ALREADY PLANNING FOR THE
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS OPENS UP
TO CONNECT TO THEIR FACILITIES,
THEIR SENSORS, THEIR DATA, THEIR
NETWORKS. IT'S GOING TO BE
AMAZING FOR SO MANY CUSTOMERS,
BUT SOME CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
DON'T WANT THEIR DATA RUNNING
OVER THE PUBLIC INTERNET. AND AS
YOU KNOW, SECURITY IS ALWAYS OUR
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. SO TODAY,
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THAT IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, KUIPER IS
ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE ENTERPRISE
READY PRIVATE CONNECTIVITY
SERVICES. AND NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE DATA FROM
VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE OVER PRIVATE
SECURE CONNECTIONS. AND AS YOU
USE USE THESE CONNECTIONS WITH
YOUR DATA, YOU CAN USE IT INSIDE
OF THE AWS CLOUD TO AN EARLY
ADOPTERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
START TESTING IN THE SECOND HALF
OF 2024. SO WE MAKE BIG BETS
LIKE THESE SO THAT CUSTOMERS CAN
DO THINGS THAT THEY COULDN'T
IMAGINE BEFORE. AND YOU COME ON
THIS JOURNEY WITH US BECAUSE
WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THESE
KINDS OF AUDACIOUS LEAPS AND THE
BENEFITS HAVE BEEN ENORMOUS. THE
EXCITING CHALLENGE AHEAD OF ALL
OF US THIS NEXT YEAR IS TO LOOK
CLOSELY AT OUR WORK AND TO
REIMAGINE IT, TO REINVENT IT, TO
DREAM UP EXPERIENCES THAT WERE
PREVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE AND MAKE
THEM REAL. WE ARE SO EXCITED TO
BE YOUR PARTNER IN THIS NEW
WORLD THAT WE'RE BUILDING
TOGETHER, AND I'M THRILLED THAT
WE GET TO EXPLORE IT. ALL THIS
WEEK. THIS MORNING. IT'S BEEN
INCREDIBLE. I WANT TO THANK ALL
OF MY GUESTS ON STAGE TODAY AND
THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WATCHING
AND OF COURSE, THANK YOU TO THE
WHOLE AWS TEAM FOR WORKING SO
HARD TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. NOW,
THE TEAM DOES HAVE ONE MORE
LITTLE SURPRISE UP UP THEIR
COLLECTIVE SLEEVE. SO I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE VERY
BEGINNING I MENTIONED LOUD AND
GUITARS IN IRELAND, BUT WE
ACTUALLY HAVE A LOUD GUITAR HERE
FROM OUR FRIENDS AT LOUDEN AND
WE'VE INVITED A TALENTED
GUITARIST A LONG TIME AWS
FAVORITE ZACH PERSON TO PLAY US
OUT. SO WE HAVE GOT A GREAT
CONFERENCE HERE FOR YOU THIS
WEEK. NOW LET'S GET OUT THERE
AND REINVENT. THANK YOU. NOW
TAKE IT AWAY, ZACH.
PLEASE WELCOME THE CEO OF AWS,
ADAM SELIPSKY.
GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE
12TH ANNUAL REINVENT. I AM SO
HAPPY TO BE HERE WITH MORE THAN
50,000 OF YOU HERE IN LAS VEGAS
AND MORE THAN 300,000 WATCHING
AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR
JOINING. THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU
. NOW, WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THIS
EVENT JUST A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENTLY AND REINVENT REMAINS
ABOVE ALL, A LEARNING
CONFERENCE, A LEARNING EVENT,
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN
AND GROW HERE ARE EVERYWHERE.
WE'VE GOT MORE THAN 2200
SESSIONS, AND YOU CAN CONNECT
WITH AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
PARTNERS IN THE EXPO ALL AROUND.
AND OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY,
MANY OPPORTUNITY WIZ TO CONNECT
WITH FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE AWS
COMMUNITY. SO WE'VE ALSO GOT A
GREAT SLATE OF KEYNOTES FOR YOU.
YESTERDAY, LAST NIGHT, HOPEFULLY
A LOT OF YOU SAW PETER DIVE INTO
ALL OF OUR INNOVATION AROUND
SERVERLESS. AND TOMORROW WE'VE
GOT SWAMI ON AI AND MACHINE
LEARNING AS WELL AS RUBA'S
PARTNER KEYNOTE. AND THEN OF
COURSE, WERNER CAPS OFF THE WEEK
ON THURSDAY. BUT I'M EXTREMELY
EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE IN
STORE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW HERE
TODAY. SO LET'S GET STARTED. SO
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT
REINVENT IS THE SHEER VARIETY OF
THE CUSTOMERS THAT I GET TO
MEET. I MEAN, FOLKS FROM EVERY
INDUSTRY, EVERY REGION, EVERY
USE CASE. AND THERE'S JUST
NOTHING LIKE IT ANYWHERE FOR AN
INNOVATORS ALL OVER THE WORLD
ARE RELYING ON AWS TO DRIVE
THEIR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING
LEADING ENTERPRISES FROM ACROSS
EVERY INDUSTRY, JUST TO NAME A
FEW IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE'RE
WORKING WITH JPMORGAN CHASE.
WE'RE WORKING WITH GOLDMAN
SACHS, NASDAQ, FIDELITY, ALLIANZ
ITYOU, BBVA, HSBC, GE CAPITAL
ONE, S&P GLOBAL NUBANK AND MORE.
IN HEALTH CARE, WE'RE WORKING
WITH PFIZER, GILEAD, MERCK, NOVO
NORDISK ROCHE, MODERNA, ILLUMINA
. MEDTRONIC 3M HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MORE. IN
AUTOMOTIVE, WE'RE WORKING WITH
EVERYBODY FROM BMW TO STELLANTIS
HONDA, TOYOTA, VW GROUP, NISSAN,
HYUNDAI, FORD MOTOR COMPANY,
MERCEDES BENZ, AND OF COURSE,
MORE. SO MANY AMAZING CUSTOMERS
AND PARTNERS AND STILL JUST A
SMATTERING OF THE LEADERS WE'RE
WORKING WITH TO SHAPE THE
FUTURES OF THESE INDUSTRIES. AND
ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
THAT THEY SERVE. ONE CUSTOMER
AND PARTNER. WE'VE BEEN WORKING
CLOSELY WITH FOR A NUMBER OF
YEARS IS SALESFORCE. SO IN 2016,
SALESFORCE CHOSE AWS AS THEIR
PRIMARY CLOUD PROVIDER, AND
TODAY SALESFORCE USES AWS
COMPUTE STORAGE DATA SERVICE AS
MANY OTHERS TO POWER KEY
SERVICES LIKE SALESFORCE, DATA
CLOUD AND MANY OTHERS. AND
YESTERDAY WE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
OUR PARTNERSHIP TO BRING NEW
CAPABILITIES TO OUR MUTUAL
CUSTOMERS. SALESFORCE IS GOING
TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
ITS ALREADY VERY LARGE USE OF
AWS. AWS WILL BE USING MORE
SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGIES AND
WE'RE MAKING IT EASIER FOR
DEVELOPERS TO QUICKLY BUILD AND
DEPLOY GENERATIVE AI
APPLICATIONS. JENS BY BRINGING
TOGETHER AMAZON BEDROCK WITH
SALESFORCE'S EINSTEIN PLATFORM.
WE'RE ALSO HELPING TO UNIFY DATA
MANAGEMENT WITH OUR NEW ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS BETWEEN SALESFORCE
DATA CLOUD AND AWS STORAGE AND
COMPUTE AND DATA SERVICE DATA
AND ANALYTICS SERVICES. SO THE
CUSTOMERS CAN GET EVEN BETTER
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND WE'RE ALSO
BUILDING TIGHTER INTEGRATIONS
BETWEEN SERVICE CLOUD FROM
SALESFORCE AND AMAZON CONNECT.
ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME,
SALESFORCE IS GOING TO BE
PUTTING ITS PRODUCTS ON THE
MARKET PLACE, MAKING IT EVEN
EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO FIND, TO
BUY AND TO MANAGE SALESFORCE
OFFERINGS. SO WITH THIS EXPANDED
PARTNERSHIP AND SALESFORCE
CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO GET NEW,
POWERFUL WAYS TO INNOVATE AND
BUILD APPLICATIONS. BUT IT'S NOT
JUST GLOBAL ENTERPRISE IS THE
MOST PROMISING UP AND COMER ALSO
CONTINUE TO CHOOSE AWS AS WELL.
ACCORDING TO PITCHBOOK, THERE
ARE MORE THAN 1000 UNICORNS OR
STARTUPS WITH OVER $1 BILLION IN
VALUATION, AND THE VAST MAJORITY
OF UNICORNS OVER 80% CHOOSE AWS
LIKE WIZ, A CLOUD SECURITY
COMPANY AND GREAT AWS PARTNER.
WIZ IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST CYBER
SECURITY UNICORN AND FASTEST
SAAS COMPANY. TO REACH A $10
BILLION VALUATION. REALLY
AMAZING OR ULTIMATE GENOMICS,
ONE OF FAST COMPANY'S MOST
INNOVATIVE COMPANIES IN BIOTECH
AND ULTIMO IS REVOLUTIONIZING
DNA SEQUENCING BY REDUCING THE
COST OF SEQUENCING SIX FOLD OR
PLAID PLAIDS. A DATA STARTUP
THAT POWERS FINTECH TOOLS LIKE
VENMO, ACORN AND ROBINHOOD THAT
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE USING TO
MANAGE THEIR FINANCES. CUSTOMERS
OF EVERY SIZE, EVERY INDUSTRY,
ORI, EVERY REGION, ORGANIZATIONS
YOU MIGHT NEVER IMAGINE CHAN
WOULD RELY ON THE CLOUD ARE
INNOVATING ON AWS. I JUST
RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT LOUDEN
GUITARS, A K10 EXPERT GUITAR
MAKER LOCATED IN A TINY VILLAGE
IN IRELAND, AND THEY'RE USING
AWS TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN
ELECTRONIC PASSPORT PROGRAM
THAT'S GOING TO EASE THE PASSAGE
OF THEIR VERY SPECIAL GUITARS
FOR MUSICIANS AS THEY TRAVEL
THROUGH CUSTOMS. I MEAN, ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES. IT'S AMAZING
ENTERPRISE WIZ AND STARTUPS,
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED
BUSINESSES, UNIVERSITIES,
COMMUNITY COLLEGES, GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, NONPROFITS. THE CLOUD
IS FOR ANYONE AND OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE SOLVING BIG PROBLEMS,
SERVING CRITICAL NEEDS AND
DREAMING UP THE WORLD'S NEXT BIG
THING. THEY COUNT ON US TO BE
SECURE, TO BE RELIABLE, TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY, TO DELIGHT
THEIR CUSTOMERS AND ENABLE NEW
WAYS TO GROW THEIR BUSINESSES.
ALL ALL ON AWS. SO WHY IS ALL
THIS HAPPENING? ON AWS, WE ARE
RELENTLESS ABOUT WORKING
BACKWARDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS
NEEDS AND FROM THEIR PAIN
POINTS. AND OF COURSE WE WERE
THE FIRST BY ABOUT 5 TO 7 YEARS
TO HAVE THIS BROADEST AND
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES THAT
WE STILL HAVE TODAY. AND WE'RE
THE MOST SECURE AND THE MOST
RELIABLE, BUT WE ALSO THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS
PROBLEMS AND THEIR POTENTIAL.
AND THIS HAS LED US TO REINVENT
CONTINUOUS ALI, TO PUSH THROUGH
THE BARRIERS OF WHAT PEOPLE
THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. SO YOU CAN
DO THE SAME. REINVENTING IS IN
OUR DNA AND IT CONTINUES TO
DRIVE US EVERY DAY. AFTER ALL,
THIS IS HOW CLOUD COMPUTING CAME
TO BE. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF
OPERATING OPERATING AMAZON.COM.
WE EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND HOW
HARD, HOW EXPENSIVE IT WAS TO
PROVISION AND MANAGE
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW MUCH OF
THE UNDIFFERENTIATED HEAVY
LIFTING THERE WAS THAT
DISTRACTED, REALLY TALENTED
TEAMS FROM REALLY INNOVATING. SO
WE SET OUT TO RETHINK IT.
INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETELY WITH
AWS. SO EVERYONE, EVEN A KID AND
A COLLEGE DORM ROOM, COULD HAVE
ACCESS TO THE SAME POWERFUL
TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO THE
LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED
ORGANIZATIONS. ALL ON DEMAND,
ALL SECURE, ALL RELIABLE AND ALL
COST EFFECTIVE. NOW IF FOLKS GOT
PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AS
THEY MOVED INTO THE CLOUD, SOME
EVEN HOSTED DATA CENTER CLOSING
PARTIES AND POSTED VIDEOS OF
SHUTTING DOWN SERVER ROOMS. IT
WAS REALLY, REALLY FUN. THIS WAS
FUN FOR US. SO WE INVENTED
REINVENTED INFRASTRUC FROM THE
GROUND UP TO OPTIMIZE AWS FOR
SCALE, FOR SECURITY, FOR
RELIABILITY, FROM ROUTERS TO
COOLING SYSTEMS TO NETWORKING
PROTOCOLS. AND BECAUSE WE LOOK
AT THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, OUR
GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE WAS
FUNDAMENTALLY DISTINCT FROM THAT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS. AND
THAT IS STILL TRUE TODAY. FOR
EXAMPLE, THE AWS GLOBAL
INFRASTRUCTURE SPANS 32
GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AROUND THE
WORLD AND WE'VE ANNOUNCED PLANS
FOR FIVE OR SO MORE EACH AND
EVERY REGION CONSISTS OF THREE
OR MORE AVAILABILITY ZONES OR
AZS AND NO OTHER CLOUD PROVIDER
PROVIDES THAT IN EVERY SINGLE
GEOGRAPHIC REGION. AND THIS IS
CRITICAL WITH EACH REGION. THE
AZS ARE PHYSICALLY SEPARATED BY
A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE UP TO 60
MILES OR 100KM. AND THEN THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH REDUNDANT
FIBER NETWORK THAT PROVIDES
SINGLE DIGIT MILLISECOND
LATENCY. NOW EACH AZ IS AT LEAST
ONE FULLY DISCRETE DATA CENTER
WITH ITS OWN REDUNDANT POWER
WATER FOR NETWORKING AND
CONNECTIVITY. SO IF THERE'S A
UTILITY FAILURE, UNEXPECTED
TRAFFIC SPIKE, HUMAN MISTAKE OR
EVEN A NATURAL DISASTER, THE
REGION REMAINS OPERATIONAL AND
SO DO YOUR APPLICATIONS. NOW,
OTHERS WOULD HAVE YOU THINK THAT
ALL CLOUDS ARE THE SAME, BUT
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. I MEAN,
IMAGINE IF YOU HAD A REGION
SUPPORTED BY A SINGLE DATA
CENTER OR IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR
PROVIDER HAD MULTIPLE AZS IN
FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND YOU
WERE RESILIENT. BUT IT TURNED
OUT THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THE
SAME LOCATION. I MEAN, ONE
INCIDENT LIKE A WATER LEAK
FOLLOWED BY A FIRE COULD TAKE
DOWN AN ENTIRE REGION FOR DAYS
DUE. HAVING THE BROADEST AND THE
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES
MATTERS LIKE HAVING THREE TIMES
THE THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF
DATA CENTERS COMPARED TO THE
NEXT LARGEST CLOUD PROVIDER,
WHICH MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN
CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY AND
HAVING 60% MORE SERVICES IN OVER
40% MORE FEATURES THAN THE NEXT
CLOSEST CLOUD PROVIDER. SO YOU
CAN INNOVATE WITHOUT
CONSTRAINTS. WE REINVENT IT SO
THAT YOU CAN REINVENT, TAKE
STORAGE, FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE
CERTAINLY DIDN'T INVENT STORAGE,
BUT WE REINVENTED HOW PEOPLE
CONSUME AND SCALE STORAGE IN THE
CLOUD WITH OUR VERY FIRST CLOUD
SERVICE, AMAZON S3, SIMPLE
STORAGE SERVICE SO BACK IN THE
DAY, STORAGE WAS PRIMARILY DISK
ARRAYS, WHICH COULD TAKE WEEKS
TO PROVISION AND OBVIOUSLY HAD
FINITE CAPACITY. SO S3 PROVIDED
HIGHLY DURABLE, HIGHLY
PERFORMANT OBJECT STORAGE THAT
CUSTOMERS COULD SCALE INSTANTLY
AND NEARLY INFINITELY. AND I
REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT S3 AT OUR
VERY FIRST TRADE SHOW IN 2006,
ON THE DAY THAT IT LAUNCHED, AND
FOLKS HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING
THE COST. I MEAN, IT WAS SO
DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN WHAT
THEY WERE USED TO, BUT WE KEPT
GOING. WE ADDED A WHOLE LOT OF
STORAGE TIERS, INCLUDING S3
GLACIER, DEEP ARCHIVE, WHICH
DELIVERS ARCHIVE STORAGE AT LESS
THAN A 10TH OF A CENT PER
GIGABYTE. BUT WHY SHOULD YOU
HAVE TO EVEN FIGURE OUT WHICH
STORAGE TIER TO USE? SO WE BUILT
S3 INTELLIGENT-TIERING TO
OPTIMIZE STORAGE BY
AUTOMATICALLY MOVING DATA TO THE
MOST EFFECTIVE ACCESS TIER WHEN
ACCESS PATTERNS CHANGE.
INTELLIGENT-TIERING HAS ALREADY
SAVED CUSTOMERS. YOU READY? OVER
$2 BILLION, BUT IT'S JUST
STORAGE, RIGHT? I MEAN, HERE'S
TO THE SAVINGS. BUT STORAGE,
RIGHT? I MEAN, SURELY THIS CAN'T
BE AN AREA THAT'S READY FOR MORE
REINVENTION. WELL, RECENTLY
WE'VE BEEN RETHINKING STORAGE
FOR YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED AND MOST LATENCY
SENSITIVE WORKLOADS, WORKLOADS
THAT NEED HIGH PERFORMANCE
ANALYTICS PROCESSING, LIKE
FINANCIAL TRADING ANALYTICS,
REAL TIME ADVERTISING, FRAUD
DETECTION AND MACHINE LEARNING
TRAINING. NOW THESE WORKLOADS
ACCESS DATA UP TO MILLIONS OF
TIMES IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AND
DO REQUIRE SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. AND SO
TODAY WHAT HAPPENS IS CUSTOMERS
MOVE DATA OFTEN FROM S3 TO
CUSTOM CACHING SOLUTIONS AND
THEN RUN ANALYTICS AT THESE
SPEEDS. BUT MANAGING MULTIPLE
STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURES AND APIS
ADDS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY. SO WE
LOOKED HARD AT WHAT WE COULD DO
TO ADD TO S3 OKAY, ARE YOU READY
FOR THE FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF
THE DAY? OKAY SO TODAY I'M
EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE AMAZON S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE, A NEW S3
STORAGE CLASS PURPOSE BUILT.
PURPOSE BUILT TO OFFER THE
HIGHEST PERFORMANCE AND LOWEST
LATENCY CLOUD OBJECT FOR STORAGE
YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY ACCESSED
DATA. S3 EXPRESS ONE ZONE USES
PURPOSE BUILT HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE TO ACCELERATE DATA
PROCESSING. IT ALSO GIVES YOU
THE OPTION TO ACTUALLY CHOOSE
YOUR AZ FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND
YOU CAN BRING YOUR FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED DATA NEXT TO YOUR HIGH
PERFORMANCE COMPUTE RESOURCE WIZ
TO MINIMIZE LATENCY. SO S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE SUPPORTS
MILLIONS OF REQUESTS PER MINUTE
WITH CONSISTENT SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. THE FASTEST
OBJECT STORAGE IN THE CLOUD AND
UP TO TEN TIMES FASTER THAN S3
STANDARD STORAGE. NOW THE FASTER
DATA PROCESSING LETS YOU SAVE UP
TO 60% ON YOUR COMPUTE COSTS AS
WELL. FOR WORKLOADS THAT REQUIRE
THE HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS
AND THE DATA ACCESS COSTS. ALSO
ARE 50% LOWER THAN S3 STANDARD.
SO YOU CAN RUN THESE WORKLOADS
AT MUCH, MUCH LOWER COST. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, WITH S3 EXPRESS, ONE
ZONE, PINTEREST HAS OBSERVED
OVER TEN TIMES FASTER RIDE
SPEEDS WHILE REDUCED THEIR TOTAL
COST BY 40% FOR ITS MACHINE
LEARNING POWERED VISUAL
INSPIRATION ENGINE. NOW THIS IS
ENABLING THEM TO DO FASTER
EXPERIMENTATION AND
PERSONALIZATION, IMPROVING
EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR USERS. SO
17 YEARS AGO, S3 REINVENTED
STORAGE BY LAUNCHING THE FIRST
CLOUD SERVICE FOR AWS AND WITH
S3 EXPRESS, ONE ZONE, YOU CAN
SEE S3 CONTINUING TO CHANGE HOW
DEVELOPERS USE STORAGE. THE SAME
SIMPLE INTERFACE AND SAME LOW
COST. AND NOW? NOW EVEN FASTER.
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
REINVENTION. GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING. SO WE REALIZED ALMOST
TEN YEARS AGO THAT IF WE WANTED
TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE
ON PRICE PERFORMANCE FOR ALL OF
YOUR WORKLOADS, WE HAD TO
REINVENT GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING FOR THE CLOUD ERA ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO THE SILICON AND
IN 2018, WE BECAME THE FIRST
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER TO DEVELOP
OUR OWN GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTE
PROCESSORS. WHEN WE ANNOUNCED
GRAVITON, OUR SERVER PROCESS OR
CHIP AND CUSTOMERS LOVE THE COST
SAVINGS THAT IT DELIVERED FOR
SCALE OUT WORKLOADS LIKE
MICROSERVICES AND WEB
APPLICATIONS, BUT ASKED FOR MORE
. SO WE BROUGHT YOU GRAVITON2,
WHICH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE SEVEN
FOLD FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF
WORKLOADS AND WE DIDN'T STOP
THERE. OUR CURRENT GENERATION.
GRAVITON THREE DELIVER IS UP TO
25. BETTER COMPUTE PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO GRAVITON2 AND THE
BEST PRICE PERFORMANCE IN EC2.
IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO USES 60%
LESS ENERGY FOR THE SAME LEVEL
OF PERFORMANCE AND THIS IS SO,
SO IMPORTANT TO SO MANY
CUSTOMERS TODAY. AND THAT'S
COMPARED TO COMPARABLE EC2
INSTANCES. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY
IS ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE
IMPORTANT. TODAY. WE'VE GOT OVER
150 GRAVITON BASED INSTANCES
ACROSS THE EC2 PORTFOLIO AND
MORE THAN 50,000 CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING ALL OF THE TOP 100 EC2
CUSTOMERS, USE GRAVITON BASED
INSTANCES TO REALIZE PRICE
PERFORMANCE BENEFITS. FOR
EXAMPLE, SAP, THEY'VE PARTNERED
WITH AWS TO ACTUALLY POWER SAP,
HANA CLOUD WITH GRAVITON AND
WITH GRAVITON. SAP HAS SEEN UP
TO 35% BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
FOR ANALYTICS WORKLOADS AND AIMS
TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT
. THEIR CARBON IMPACT BY AN
ESTIMATED 45. SUPER IMPRESSIVE
OF WE ARE RELENTLESS ABOUT
INNOVATION AND WE CONTINUE TO
PUSH THE ENVELOPE FURTHER. SO
TODAY I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THE LATEST GENERATION OF OUR
GRAVITON PROCESSOR AWS GRAVITON.
FOUR GRAVITON FOUR OR GRAVITON
FOUR IS THE MOST POWERFUL AND
THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT CHIP
THAT WE HAVE EVER BUILT, WITH
50% MORE CORES AND 75% MORE
MEMORY BANDWIDTH THAN GRAVITON.
THREE GRAVITON, FOUR CHIPS ARE
30% FASTER ON AVERAGE THAN
GRAVITON. THREE AND PERFORM EVEN
BETTER FOR CERTAIN WORKLOADS,
LIKE 40% FASTER FOR DATABASE
APPLICATIONS AND 45% FASTER FOR
JAVA APPLICATIONS AS WE WERE THE
FIRST TO DEVELOP AND OFFER OUR
OWN SERVER PROCESSORS, WE'RE NOW
IN OUR FOURTH GENERATION. IN
JUST FIVE YEARS. OTHER CLOUD
PROVIDERS HAVE NOT EVEN
DELIVERED ON THEIR FIRST SERVER
PROCESSORS YET. WE'RE ALSO
ANNOUNCING THE PREVIEW OF OUR
FIRST INSTANCE BASED ON GRAVITON
FOUR RAG INSTANCES AS RAG IS
PART OF OUR MEMORY OPTIMIZED
INSTANCE FAMILY. THEY'RE
DESIGNED TO DELIVER FAST, FAST
PERFORMANCE FOR WORKLOADS. THAT
PROCESS LARGE DATA SETS AND
MEMORY LIKE DATABASES OR REAL
TIME BIG DATA ANALYTICS. RAG
INSTANCES PROVIDE THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY
EFFICIENCY FOR MEMORY INTENSIVE
WORKLOADS AND THERE ARE MANY,
MANY MORE GRAVITON. FOUR
INSTANCES COMING HIGHLY RELIABLE
REGIONS WITH AVAILABILITY ZONES
DURABLE, INSTANTLY SCALABLE, LOW
COST STORAGE, LEADING PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITH CUSTOM DESIGNED
CHIPS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW
EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'RE
REINVENTING TO CONSTANTLY
DELIVER WHAT YOU NEED TO DRIVE
YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE, YOUR
INNOVATION, AND YOUR BUSINESSES.
AND FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES WE
HAVE BEEN SO INTENT ON PROVIDING
YOU WITH THE BROADEST AND
DEEPEST FUNCTIONALITY WITH THE
FAST PACE OF INNOVATION, THE
MOST RELIABLE, THE MOST SECURE
CLOUD SERVICES AND OF COURSE THE
LARGEST AND THE MOST DIVERSE
COMMUNITY OF CUSTOMERS AND
PARTNERS. NOW THESE ADVANTAGES
ARE ALWAYS RELEVANT, BUT NO MORE
SO THAN TODAY, BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALSO THE FOUNDATION FOR
REINVENTING WITH GENERATIVE AI I
NOW HERE TO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
THE BROADEST AND DEEPEST
CAPABILITIES, THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY AND
THE PRIVACY YOU TRUST. YOU NEED
AT ALL. AMAZON HAS BEEN
INNOVATING WITH AI FOR DECADES.
WE USE IT ACROSS THE COMPANY TO
OPTIMIZE THINGS LIKE OUR COMPANY
WIDE SUPPLY CHAIN TO CREATE
BETTER RETAIL SEARCH
CAPABILITIES, WIZ TO DELIVER NEW
EXPERIENCES LIKE AMAZON, ALEXA
OR OUR JUST WALK OUT SHOPPING
TECHNOLOGY. GENAI IS THE NEXT
STEP IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,
AND IT IS GOING TO REINVENT
EVERY APPLICATION THAT WE
INTERACT WITH AT WORK AND AT
HOME. WE'RE READY TO HELP YOU
REINVENT WITH GENERATIVE AI
BECAUSE AGAIN, WE THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES
TO MEET YOUR NEEDS AND WE
REINVENT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND
BECAUSE WE'RE INTIMATELY
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT MEANS TO
REINVENT OURSELVES AS WE
UNDERSTAND HOW TO HELP YOU WITH
YOUR REINVENTIONS. FROM STARTUPS
TO ENTERPRISES, ORGANIZATIONS OF
ALL SIZES ARE GETTING GOING WITH
GENERATIVE AI. THEY WANT TO TAKE
THE MOMENTUM THAT THEY'RE
BUILDING WITH EARLY
EXPERIMENTATION AND TURN IT INTO
REAL WORLD PRODUCTIVITY GAINS
AND INNOVATE, INNOVATE,
INNOVATE. SO WE THINK ABOUT
GENERATIVE AI AS HAVING ACTUALLY
THREE MACRO LAYERS, IF YOU WILL,
OF A STACK. AND THEY'RE ALL
EQUALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE ARE
INVESTING IN ALL THREE OF THEM.
SO THE BOTTOM LAYER IS USED TO
TRAIN FOUNDATION MODELS, OTHER
AND LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, FMS,
WE'LL CALL THEM AND TO RUN THESE
MODELS IN PRODUCTION, THE MIDDLE
LAYER PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE LMS
AND OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
YOU NEED AND ALL THE TOOLS THAT
YOU NEED TO BUILD AND SCALE
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
THEM. AND THEN AT THE TOP LAYER,
WE'VE GOT APPLICATIONS THAT ARE
BUILT USING FMS SO THAT YOU CAN
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GENERATIVE AI
QUICKLY WITHOUT EVEN NEEDING ANY
SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE. SO LET'S
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LAYER
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WITH, WITH,
WITH THE FOUNDATION MODELS,
THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF
WORKLOADS TRAINING AND INFERENCE
AND TRAINING IS TO CREATE AND
PROVE FMS BY LEARNING PATTERNS
FROM LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRAINING,
DATA AND INFERENCE. USE THAT TO
RUN THE MODELS IN PRODUCTION TO
GENERATE AN OUTPUT SUCH AS TEXT
OR IMAGES OR VIDEO. AND THESE
WORKLOADS CONSUME MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF COMPUTE POWER. SO TO
MAKE GENAI GENAI USE CASES
ECONOMICAL AND FEASIBLE, ALL YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR TRAINING, YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR INFERENCE ON
INCREDIBLY PERFORMANT, COST
EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR ML AND AI. NOW
GPUS ARE THE CHIPS THAT CAN
PERFORM A HIGH VOLUME OF
MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS,
SIMULTANEOUS ALI MAKING THEM
POPULAR FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT
WORKLOADS FROM ML SIMULATIONS,
3D RENDERING. AND WE'VE BEEN
COLLABORATING WITH NVIDIA FOR
OVER 13 YEARS TO BRING GPUS TO
THE CLOUD BUILT ON COMPUTE
INSTANCES THAT SUPPORT A WIDE
RANGE OF USE CASES, INCLUDING
GRAPH SIX GAMING HPC, MACHINE
LEARNING, AND NOW OF COURSE
DEMAND AND GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS. IN 2010, AWS WAS THE
FIRST TO BRING NVIDIA GPUS TO
THE CLOUD WITH KG ONE OR THE
CLUSTER GPU INSTANCE. THEN WE
WERE THE FIRST TO OFFER NVIDIA V
100 GPUS WITH OUR P THREE
INSTANCES AND THEN WE WERE AGAIN
THE FIRST TO OFFER THE A 100
TENSOR CORE GPUS WITH OUR P FOUR
INSTANCES IN PRODUCTION AND
EARLIER THIS YEAR, YES, WE WERE
THE FIRST MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER
TO BRING NVIDIA H100 GPUS TO
MARKET WITH OUR P FIVE INSTANCES
AND THE P FIVE ARE PROVIDING
AMAZING PERFORMANCE FOR
TRAINING. THEY'RE UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER AND 40% LESS
EXPENSIVE THAN P FOUR SECONDS.
NOW HAVING THE BEST CHIPS IS
GREAT AND NECESSARY, BUT TO
DELIVER THE NEXT LEVEL OF
PERFORMANCE, YOU NEED MORE THAN
JUST THE BEST GPUS. YOU ALSO
NEED REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE
CLUSTERS OF SERVERS THAT ARE
RUNNING THESE GPUS. OUR GPU
INSTANCES CAN BE DEPLOYED IN EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH UP TO 3200
GIGABITS PER SECOND OF
NETWORKING THROUGH OUR ELASTIC
FABRIC ADAPTER OR EFA. AND THIS
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
20,000 GPUS IN A SINGLE CLUSTER
FOR PROVIDING UP TO 20 EXAFLOPS
OF AGGREGATE COMPUTE COMPUTE
CAPACITY, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO
A SUPERCOMPUTER. AND ALL OF OUR
GPU INSTANCES THAT ARE RELEASED
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS ARE BASED
ON OUR BREAKTHROUGH NITRO
SYSTEM, WHICH REINVENT NOTED
VIRTUALIZATION BY OFFLOADING
STORAGE AND NETWORKING TO
SPECIALIZED CHIPS SO THAT ALL OF
THE SERVICE COMPUTE IS DEDICATED
TO RUNNING YOUR WORKLOADS. AND
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT OTHER
CLOUD PROVIDERS CAN OFFER. AGAIN
NOW WITH NITRO THIS DELIVERS
PERFORMANCE INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM BARE METAL, BUT AT A LOWER
PRICE. AND THE NITRO SYSTEM ALSO
PROVIDES ENHANCED SECURITY THAT
CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS AND
PROTECTS AND VERIFIES THAT THE
INSTANCE HARDWARE AND FIRMWARE
ARE ALL ROBUST. WE'VE WORKED
CLOSELY WITH NVIDIA TO INTEGRATE
OUR NETWORKING AND OUR
VIRTUALIZATION CAPABILITIES WITH
THEIR CHIPS TO BRING OUR GPU
INSTANCES TO CUSTOMERS AND TODAY
I'M THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE
ARE EXPANDING OUR PARTNERSHIP
WITH NVIDIA WITH MORE
INNOVATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO
DELIVER THE MOST ADVANCED
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS WITH, WITH WITH GPUS
AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE JENSEN
HUANG, FOUNDER AND CEO OF NVIDIA
HERE ON STAGE WITH US TO TELL US
MORE. KALLEL JENSEN, SO GOOD TO
SEE YOU. I'M THRILLED TO BE
HERE. YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US TODAY. IT'S
AMAZING. SO AS I'VE JUST
DISCUSSED, WE'VE GOT A LONG
PARTNERSHIP. AWS NVIDIA. I'VE
BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME
TOGETHER AND I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT HOW THE TEAMS ARE
COLLABORATING. YOU AND I WERE
TALKING ABOUT THAT BACKSTAGE.
THE COLLABORATION IS AMAZING.
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LOT OF
YEARS AND I'M JUST THRILLED TO
DEEPEN THE PARTNERSHIP. THANK
YOU. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. I'M
THRILLED TO BE HERE TO CELEBRATE
THE AMAZING WORK OF OUR TWO
TEAMS AND TO HELP ANNOUNCE OUR
BIG NEW PARTNERSHIP. YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR
A VERY LONG TIME. IN FACT, AWS
WAS THE WORLD'S FIRST CLOUD TO
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GPU
ACCELERATED COMPUTING. AND YOU
PUT THE WORLD'S FIRST GPUS IN
THE CLOUD A LONG TIME AGO. AND
SINCE THEN, THIS IS AN AMAZING
STATISTIC. SIX IN THE LAST
SEVERAL YEARS ALONE, JUST FOR
THE AMPERE AND HOPPER GENERATION
WE'VE PUT UP DEPLOYED BOYD TO
MILNE, XEON CPUS IN AWS THAT'S
THREE Z FLOPS. 3000 EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER HOURS MOST YEAH
EXACTLY. YEAH MOST NATIONS WILL
BE HAPPY WITH ONE EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER AND AWS HAS 3000
OF THEM AND WE ARE JUST JUST
GETTING STARTED. I'M DELIGHTED
TO SEE THAT WE ARE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE TODAY A DEPLOYMENT OF A
WHOLE NEW FAMILY OF GPUS, THE L4
, THE L4 IS AND THE BRAND NEW H
200, THE H 200. THIS IS REALLY
AMAZING THING. THE COMBINATION
BETWEEN THE BRAND NEW TENSOR LLM
OPTIMIZING COMPILERS FOR
GENERATIVE AI AND H 200 IMPROVES
THE THROUGHPUT OF IN INFERENCE
LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL INFERENCE
BY A FACTOR OF FOUR REDUCING THE
COST IN JUST ONE YEAR BY A
FACTOR OF FOUR. NOW OUR
COLLABORATION STARTS WITH, OF
COURSE GREAT GPUS AND WE'RE
RAMPING SO INCREDIBLY FAST EACH
QUARTER. WE'RE STANDING UP AND
DEPLOYING MORE THAN ONE SET OF
FLOPS. MORE FOR AN AWS ONE XEN
OF FLOPS MORE EACH QUARTER. IT'S
AN UNBELIEVABLE NUMBER AND ALL
OF THIS IS, OF COURSE, MADE
POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE
ACCELERATED COMPUTING LIBRARIES.
OUR TWO TEAMS STOOD UP A WHOLE
BUNCH OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT
WE'RE ALSO BRINGING OUR MOST
POPULAR LIBRARIES, THE NVIDIA,
AI STACK, OUR NEMO LLM LARGE
LANGUAGE MODEL FRAMEWORK. THE
RETRIEVER FOR INFERENCE MODEL
FOR RAGS, OUR BIO NEMO DIGITAL
BIOLOGY, LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
FOUNDATION MODELS. ISAAC SIM ON
OMNIVERSE FOR ROBOTICS. THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT AMAZON ROBOTICS
USES TO SIMULATE ITS ROBOTS AND
ITS INCREDIBLE WAREHOUSES THAT
YOU GUYS DO. JUST ALL OF THESE
STACKS, SOFTWARE STACKS AND
LIBRARIES WE'RE GOING TO
INTEGRATE INTO AWS. SO OUR TWO
TEAMS HAVE BEEN REALLY, REALLY
BUSY. BUSY INDEED. AND THAT WAS
A LOT OF THAT WAS A LOT OF
ZETAS. AND EVERYTHING. YEAH. SO
AS YOU SAID, THE COLLABORATION
IS GOING TO ENABLE DEVELOPERS TO
ACCESS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY AND
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED IT TO
INNOVATE WITH GENERATIVE AI. NOW
THE ONE OF THE BIG
ANNOUNCEMENTS, OF COURSE, IS
THAT AWS IS GOING TO BE THE
FIRST CLOUD PROVIDER TO BRING
THE LATEST NVIDIA 200
GRACE-HOPPER SUPER CHIPS WITH A
NEW MULTI-NODE NVLINK TO THE
CLOUD FIRST PLACE. AND MAYBE YOU
CAN TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT THAT AND WHAT MAKES THAT
COMPUTING PLATFORM SO POWERFUL
AND HOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER
TO INTRODUCE IT. WELL, WE'RE
BOTH REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT ARM
PROCESSORS AND THE REASON WHY
ARM IS SO INCREDIBLE IS BECAUSE
WE CAN WE CAN MOLD IT TO EXACTLY
THE TYPE OF COMPUTING NEEDS THAT
WE HAVE. IT'S INCREDIBLY LOW
ENERGY. IT'S INCREDIBLY COST
EFFECTIVE. AND SO GRACE-HOPPER,
WHICH IS GX 200, CONNECTS TWO
REVOLUTIONARY PROCESSORS
TOGETHER IN A REALLY UNIQUE WAY.
IT CONNECTS THEM TOGETHER USING
A CHIP TO CHIP INTERCONNECT
CALLED NVLINK AT ONE TERABYTE
BYTES PER SECOND, AND IT'S
CONNECTED IN A COHERENT WAY SO
THAT THE GPU CAN ACCESS ALL OF
THE CPU'S MEMORY. THE CPU CAN
ACCESS ALL OF THE GPU'S MEMORY
AND SO THE TWO OF THESE
PROCESSORS COULD WORK HAND IN
HAND IN A REALLY FAST WAY. THE
SECOND THING THAT WE DID WAS WE
INVENTED A NEW WAY OF EXTENDING
NVLINK TO A VERY LARGE DOMAIN.
SO NOW 32 GRACE HOPPERS COULD BE
CONNECTED BY A BRAND NEW NVLINK
SWITCH, AND THAT BECOMES ONE
UNIT. AND WITH THE NITRO AWS
NITRO THAT BECOMES BASICALLY ONE
GIANT VIRTUAL GPU INSTANCE. I
MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE
THIS. YOU'VE GOT 30 2H2
HUNDREDS. INCREDIBLE HORSEPOWER
IN ONE VIRTUAL INSTANCE BECAUSE
OF AWS NITRO. AND THEN WE
CONNECT IT WITH AWS, EFA YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY FAST NETWORKING ING
ALL OF THESE UNITS NOW CAN
CREATE INTO A ULTRA CLUSTER AND
AWS GLUE CLUSTER. SO I CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE ALL THIS COME
TOGETHER. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE COMBINATION.
I MEAN, HOW CUSTOMERS ARE GOING
TO USE THIS STUFF. ONE CAN ONLY
IMAGINE AND I KNOW THAT THE TH
TWO HUNDREDS ARE REALLY GOING TO
SUPERCHARGE WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE
DOING. IT'S GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE OF COURSE, IN EC2
INSTANCES COMING SOON. NOW IN
THE WORLD OF GENERATIVE AI, A
LOT OF COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO,
UH, TO ONBOARD AI INTO THEIR
BUSINESS AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE
THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT IT
EXTENDS TO THE SOFTWARE, THE
SERVICES AND ALL OF THE OTHER
WORKFLOWS THAT THEY HAVE. SO
THIS LEADS OF COURSE, TO THE
SECOND BIG ANNOUNCEMENT WE HAVE
TODAY. SO PARTNERING NVIDIA TO
BRING THE NVIDIA DGX CLOUD TO
AWS AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE DGX
CLOUD IS IMPORTANT PLATFORM FOR
CUSTOMERS. WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
DGX CLOUD IS NVIDIA'S AI
FACTORY. THIS IS HOW OUR
RESEARCHERS ADVANCE AI. WE USE
AI TO DO NEURAL GRAPHICS. THE
WAY WE DO COMPUTER GRAPHICS
TODAY IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT AI.
WE USE AI TO ADVANCE. WE USE OUR
AI FACTORIES TO ADVANCE OUR
DIGITAL BIOLOGY MODELS, OUR
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS USE IT FOR
ROBOTICS, FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS.
WE USE IT TO SIMULATE EARTH, TO
A DIGITAL TWIN OF THE EARTH, TO
PREDICT WEATHER AND CLIMATE. IT
AND SO THE CLOUD IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO US. WE'RE
INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BUILD THE
LARGEST AI FACTORY NVIDIA HAS
EVER BUILT. WE'RE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE INSIDE OUR COMPANY WE
CALL IT PROJECT CIBA CIBA. YOU
ALL PROBABLY KNOW SINCE YOU'RE
AT A CONFERENCE IS THE LARGEST,
MOST MAGNIFICENT TREE IN THE
AMAZON. WE CALL IT PROJECT CIBA.
CIBA IS GOING TO BE 16,000 AND
16,384 GPUS CONNECTED INTO ONE
GIANT AI SUPERCOMPUTER. FOR THIS
IS UTTERLY INCREDIBLE. WE WILL
BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE TRAINING
TIME OF THE LARGEST LANGUAGE
MODELS. THE NEXT GENERATION
MOISES THESE LARGE EXTREMELY
LARGE MIXTURE MIXTURE OF
EXPERTS, MODELS AND BE ABLE TO
TRAIN IT IN JUST HALF OF THE
TIME, ESSENTIALLY REDUCE THE
COST OF TRAINING IN JUST ONE
YEAR IN HALF. NOW WE'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO TRAIN MUCH, MUCH
LARGER MULTI-MODAL MO MODELS
THIS NEXT GENERATION, LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS, THESE 16,000
GPUS WILL BE 65 EXAFLOPS. IT'S
LIKE 65 EXASCALE SUPERCOMPUTERS
IN ONE. AND SO I CAN'T WAIT FOR
US TO STAND THIS UP. OUR AI
RESEARCHERS ARE CHOMPING AT THE
BIT. NOW, OF COURSE, THIS IS
ALSO A PLACE WHERE WE
COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS AND
CUSTOMERS WHO NEED TO BUILD
CUSTOM AI MODELS. YOU KNOW, IT'S
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO USE OFF THE
SHELF MODELS AND THERE'S BE A
WHOLE BUNCH OF OFF THE SHELF
MODELS IN PUBLIC CLOUDS. IT'S
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN A
SOFTWARE PLATFORM. COMPANIES,
SAAS COMPANIES, FOR EXAMPLE,
SALESFORCE THAT YOU MENTIONED
EARLIER, THEY'LL HAVE ALL KINDS
OF OFF THE SHELF COPILOTS AND
GENERATIVE AI MODELS. BUT A LOT
OF COMPANIES NEED TO BUILD THEIR
OWN PROPRIETARY MODELS. AND SO
WE SET UP THE AI FACTORY. SO
THAT WE COULD PARTNER WITH THEM
TO HELP THEM CREATE THEIR CUSTOM
AIS, AND NOW THEY'LL RUN ALL ON
AWS. WE'LL DEVELOP THE MODEL ON
AWS, COLLABORATE WITH OUR
CUSTOMERS ON AWS, CONNECT THEM
ALL TO YOUR SERVICES AND STORAGE
SERVICES, SECURITY SERVICES AND
ALL KINDS OF OTHER GENERATIVE AI
SERVICES AND THEN DEPLOY IT ALL
IN AWS. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO DO THIS VERY FIRST TIME
IN AWS. IT'S ALL AMAZING. I
MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING
AMAZING THINGS. WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD TO SEE US COME
TOGETHER EVEN MORE TIGHTLY. I
MEAN, IT'S JUST GOING TO BRING
INCREDIBLE BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS
WHO ARE REALLY GOING TO NEED IT.
WE APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION,
APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU AND
LOOK FORWARD TO A LOT MORE OF
THAT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU,
ADAM. THANK YOU. JENSEN. HAVE A
GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. IT'S BEEN
A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. WE REALLY
APPRECIATED IT. NOW LET'S TALK
ABOUT CAPACITY OR ACTUALLY
GETTING ACCESS TO ALL OF THAT
AMAZING COMPUTE. SO CUSTOMERS
WHO WANT TO BUILD AND TRAIN
MODELS OFTEN NEED LARGE AMOUNTS
OF RELIABLE CLUSTERED CAPACITY.
IT HAS TO BE TOGETHER OR IN
CLUSTERS, BUT THEY DON'T
NECESSARILY NEED THE SAME AMOUNT
OF IT ALL THE TIME.
FOR EXAMPLE, CUSTOMERS TRAINING A MODEL. I
MEAN, THEY MIGHT STOP TO
EVALUATE NEWS, USE NEW TRAINING
DATA OR MAKE OTHER CHANGES, AND
THEN THEY WANT TO DO MORE
TRAINING. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS
THAT THEY OFTEN NEED SHORT TERM
CLUSTERED CAPACITY AND IT'S
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NO ONE, NO
CLOUD HAS BEEN ADDRESSING UNTIL
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
FOR ML AND EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
WERE THE FIRST CONSUMPTION MODEL
IN THE INDUSTRY THAT ENABLES ANY
CUSTOMER TO RESERVE THE HIGHLY
SOUGHT AFTER GPU CAPACITY TO RUN
FOR SHORT DURATION MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS. AND THIS
ELIMINATES THE NEED TO HOLD ON
TO THE CAPACITY HOLDING CAPACITY
THAT THEY'RE USING JUST SO THEY
CAN BE CERTAIN THAT THEY CAN USE
IT LATER IF THEY NEED TO USE IT
LATER. NOW EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
ARE DEPLOYED IN ULTRACLUSTERS
INTERCONNECTED WITH OUR EFA
NETWORKING THAT WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THIS MORNING AND THAT
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
HUNDREDS OF GPUS IN A SINGLE
CLUSTER WITH THIS NEW OFFERING.
SO WITH THE CAPACITY BLOCKS,
CUSTOMERS CAN PLAN FOR THEIR ML
WORKLOAD DEPLOYMENTS WITH
CERTAINTY AND THEY KNOW THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE GPU
CAPACITY WHEN THEY NEED IT AND
ONLY WHEN THEY NEED IT. NOW
SUPPORT FOR THE LATEST
GENERATION. HIGH PERFORMANCE
GPUS COMBINED WITH OUR
INNOVATIONS, VIRTUALIZATION,
NETWORKING, CLUSTER MANAGEMENT.
THESE ARE REASONS WHY AWS IS THE
BEST PLACE TO RUN GPUS IN THE
WORLD, BUT TO DRIVE INNOVATION
AND THE BROAD CHOICES THAT OUR
CUSTOMERS WANT IN ML AND AI, WE
REALIZED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT
AGAIN HERE IS ANOTHER PLACE WE'D
HAVE TO INNOVATE ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO THE SILICON, JUST LIKE
WE DID WITH GRAVITON FOR GENERAL
PURPOSE COMPUTING AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT TRAINIUM AND INFERENTIA
. SO TRAINIUM IS OUR PURPOSE
BUILT CHIP FOR TRAINING, MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS, MACHINE
LEARNING MODELS AND INFERENTIA
IS OUR CHIP OPTIMIZED FOR
RUNNING INFERENCE ON THOSE
MODELS? SO EARLIER THIS YEAR WE
ALREADY ANNOUNCED THE SECOND
GENERATION OF OUR INFERENTIA
CHIP INFERENTIA TO AND BECAUSE
WE OPTIMIZE FOR INFERENCE, THE
TWO INSTANCES POWERED BY
INFERENTIA TO ARE OFFER THE BEST
LOWEST COST INFERENCE IN EC2
WHILE ALSO DELIVERING UP TO FOUR
TIMES HIGHER THROUGHPUT AND TEN
TIMES LOWER LATENCY COMPARED TO
THE INF1 INSTANCES. CUSTOMERS
LIKE ADOBE, DEUTSCHE TELEKOM,
LEONARDO, AI, THEY'VE ALL SEEN
GREAT EARLY RESULTS AND THEY ARE
DEPLOYING THEIR GENERATIVE AI AI
MODELS AT SCALE WITH INFERENTIA
TO. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF
INTEREST IN TRAINIUM AS WELL.
OUR TRN1 INSTANCES POWERED BY
TRAINIUM HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED BY A
LOT OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
ANTHROPIC PARTNERS LIKE
DATABRICKS AND RICOH AND OUR OWN
AMAZON SEARCH TEAM USES TRN1
INSTANCES TO TRAIN TRAIN A
LARGE, DEEP, LARGE SCALE, DEEP
LEARNING MODELS. THEY'RE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF A TRAINIUM HIGH
PERFORMANCE SCALE RELIABILITY
AND LOW COST. BUT AS CUSTOMERS
CONTINUE TO TRAIN BIGGER AND
BIGGER MODELS ON LARGER AND
LARGER DATA SETS, WE REALIZED WE
NEEDED TO KEEP PUSHING AND
PUSHING OUR PRICE PERFORMANCE.
WE'RE NEVER DONE THERE. AND
TODAY I'M REALLY EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE AWS TRAINIUM TO OUR
SECOND GENERATION. IT'S OUR
SECOND GENERATION CHIP. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR HIGH
PERFORMANCE TRAINING OF
FOUNDATION MODELS, TRAINING IS
DESIGNED TO DELIVER UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO OUR FIRST GENERATION
CHIPS AND THAT MAKES IT IDEAL
FOR TRAINING FOUNDATION MODELS
WITH HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OR
EVEN TRILLIONS OF PARAMETERS.
TRAINIUM TWO IS GOING TO POWER
THE NEXT GENERATION OF EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND WILL DELIVER
UP TO 65 EXAFLOPS OF AGGREGATE
COMPUTE AND WE EXPECT THE FIRST
TRAINIUM TWO BASED INSTANCES ARE
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR
AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO DO
WITH THEM. MEANWHILE ALL A LOT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS ARE
STILL JUST TALKING ABOUT THEIR
OWN. ML CHIPS. WE'VE ALSO MADE A
LOT OF EXCITING PROGRESS IN
BUILDING THE SOFTWARE TOOLCHAIN
THAT SUPPORTS TRAINIUM IN
INFERENTIA. SO AWS NEURON IS OUR
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT THAT
HELPS CUSTOMERS GET MAXIMUM
PERFORMANCE FROM ML CHIPS. NEW
RON SUPPORTS MACHINE LEARNING
FRAMEWORKS LIKE TENSORFLOW
PYTORCH WITH JAX SUPPORT COMING
REALLY SOON AND SO CUSTOMERS CAN
USE THEIR EXISTING KNOWLEDGE TO
BUILD TRAINING AND INFERENCE
PIPELINES WITH JUST A FEW LINES
OF CODE AND NEURON SUPPORTS THE
MOST POPULAR MODELS, INCLUDING
93 OF THE TOP 100 AND COUNTING.
IMPORTANTLY, YOU ALSO NEED THE
RIGHT TOOLS TO HELP TRAIN AND
DEPLOY YOUR MODELS AND THIS IS
WHY WE HAVE AMAZON SAGEMAKER OUR
MANAGED SERVICE. THAT MAKES IT
EASY FOR DEVELOPERS TO TRAIN,
TUNE, BUILD, MANAGE MACHINE
LEARNING AND FOUNDATION MODELS.
IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE WE
LAUNCHED SAGEMAKER, WE'VE
INTRODUCED A LOT OF POWERFUL
INNOVATIONS LIKE AUTOML MODEL
TUNING, DISTRIBUTED TRAINING,
FLEXIBLE MODEL DEPLOYMENT TOOLS
FOR ML OPS AND BUILT IN FEATURES
LIKE RESPONSIBLE AI. SAGEMAKER
HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN
DEMOCRATIZING ML FOR TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING STABILITY AI AI21LABS
LABS, THOMSON REUTERS,
ASTRAZENECA, 3M, HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AWS,
FERRARI AND MORE, AND SAGEMAKER
CAN TRAIN MODELS WITH UP TO
BILLIONS OF PARAMETERS FOR
EXAMPLE, TI HAS TRAINED 180
BILLION PARAMETER FALCON FM,
WHICH IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MODEL ON
SAGEMAKER USING 3000 GPUS AND
PETABYTES OF PETABYTES OF DATA
STORED IN S3. AND YOU CAN ALSO
DEPLOY THIS TOP RANKED MODEL
USING SAGEMAKER. WE'VE ALSO BEEN
WORKING CLOSELY WITH HUGGINGFACE
TO SUPPORT THEIR MODELS ON
SAGEMAKER AND HAVE COLLABORATED
TO CREATE THE HUGGING FACE DEEP
LEARNING CONTAINERS TO HELP
ACCELERATE TRAINING AND
DEPLOYMENT OF FMS USING
SAGEMAKER, TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA. SO IF YOU'RE
BUILDING YOUR OWN MODELS. AWS IS
RELENTLESSLY FOCUSED ON
EVERYTHING YOU NEED THE BEST
CHIPS, THE MOST ADVANCED
VIRTUALIZATION, POWERFUL
PETABYTE SCALE NETWORKING
CAPABILITIES, HYPER SCALE
CLUSTERING AND THE RIGHT TOOLS
TO HELP YOU BUILD. BUT OF
COURSE, AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF
ORGANIZATIONS JUST WANT TO BE
ABLE TO ACCESS THE MOST POWERFUL
MODELS OUT THERE. THEY WANT TO
GET STARTED QUICKLY,
EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT FMS
AND TESTING DIFFERENT USE CASES
AND TO MEET THE ENORMOUS
OPPORTUNITY HEAD ON. BUT THEY
ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH
MODEL SHOULD I EVEN USE AND HOW
DO I DECIDE WHICH ARE BEST FOR
MY APPLICATION? TITAN HOW CAN I
MOVE QUICKLY TO BUILD AND DEPLOY
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS? JENS
AND HOW CAN I KEEP MY DATA
SECURE AND PRIVATE? THAT'S WHY
WE'RE INVESTING IN THAT MIDDLE
LAYER OF THE STACK. SO NOW WE
KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU NEED IT TO
BE EASIER TO ACCESS A POWERFUL
AND DIVERSE SET OF MODELS. LMS
OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS, AND
THEN TO QUICKLY BUILD
APPLICATIONS WITH THEM ALL THE
TIME, MAINTAINING YOUR SECURITY
AND PRIVACY AND THAT'S WHY WE
BUILT AMAZON BEDROCK SO BEDROCK
IS THE EASIEST WAY TO BUILD AND
SCALE GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS
FOR LMS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS AND CUSTOMERS IN EVERY
INDUSTRY ARE ALREADY USING
BEDROCK TO REINVENT THEIR USER
EXPERIENCES, THEIR PRODUCTS AND
THEIR PROCESSES, AND TO BRING AI
INTO THE HEART OF THEIR
BUSINESSES. SO WHY BEDROCK? SO
FIRST, YOU ENJOY THE BROADEST
CHOICE OF MODELS, MANY OF WHICH
ARE AVAILABLE FIRST OR IN SOME
CASES ONLY ON BEDROCK YOU CAN
ADD YOUR OWN BUSINESS CONTEXT
QUICKLY, EASILY AND PRIVATELY
WITH THE BROADEST SELECTION OF
CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS AND YOU
GET ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
AND PRIVACY. BECAUSE WE DESIGNED
IT THAT WAY FROM DAY ONE. AND
THE CUSTOMER EXCITEMENT HAS BEEN
OVERWHELMING. WE MADE THE
SERVICE GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN
SEPTEMBER AND NOW OVER 10,000
CUSTOMERS ARE USING BEDROCK
AROUND THE WORLD ACROSS
VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY, ADIDAS
HAS ENABLING DEVELOPERS TO GET
QUICK, ACCURATE ANSWERS TO DEEP
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, AS CARRIER
IS USING BEDROCK TO COMBINE
HISTORICAL ACTIONS, PREDICTIVE
ANALYTICS SYSTEMS, ALERTS AND
DATA TRENDS TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THESE ARE
HELPING CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR
ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CUT
CARBON EMISSIONS. NASDAQ IS
USING BEDROCK TO AUTOMATE
INVESTIGATIVE WORKFLOWS ON
SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS AND TO
STRENGTHEN THEIR ANTI ANTI
FINANCIAL CRIME AND SURVEILLANCE
CAPABILITIES. SO MANY MORE,
INCLUDING BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES, CLARIANT COX
AUTOMOTIVE, GODADDY. LEXISNEXIS.
MERCK OMNICOM GROUP ARE ALL
USING BEDROCK. THEY'RE ALL USING
IT TO BUILD GENAI APPLICATIONS.
TODAY BUT IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS.
EVERY ONE IS MOVING FAST,
EXPERIMENTING AND LEARNING. AND
AT THE SAME TIME, THE GENERATIVE
AI TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IS EVOLVING
QUICKLY WITH NEW DEVELOPMENTS
PRACTICALLY EVERY DAY AND
CUSTOMERS ARE FINDING THAT
DIFFERENT MODELS ACTUALLY WORK
BETTER FOR DIFFERENT USE CASES
OR ON DIFFERENT SETS OF DATA.
SOME MODELS ARE GREAT FOR
SUMMARIZATION, OTHERS ARE GOOD
FOR REASONING AND INTEGRATION,
AND STILL OTHERS HAVE AWESOME
LANGUAGE SUPPORT. AND THEN
THERE'S IMAGE GENERATION IN
SEARCH USE CASES AND MORE, ALL
COMING FROM BOTH PROPRIETARY
MODELS AND MODELS THAT ARE
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY.
I MEAN, THINGS ARE MOVING SO
FAST AND IN THAT TYPE OF
ENVIRONMENT THAT THE ABILITY TO
ADAPT IS THE MOST VALUABLE
CAPABILITY THAT YOU CAN HAVE.
THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE
MODEL TO RULE THEM ALL, AND
THERE'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE ONE COMPANY PROVIDING THE
MODELS THAT EVERYBODY USES. SO
YOU DON'T WANT A CLOUD PROVIDER
WHO'S BEHOLDEN PRIMARILY TO ONE
MODEL PROVIDER. YOU NEED TO BE
TRYING OUT DIFFERENT MODELS. YOU
NEED TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH
BETWEEN THEM RAPIDLY OR EVEN
COMBINING THEM WITH THE SAME USE
CASES. AND YOU NEED A REAL
CHOICE OF MODEL PROVIDERS AS YOU
DECIDE WHO'S GOT THE BEST
TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO WHO HAS THE
DEPENDABILITY THAT YOU NEED IN A
BUSINESS PARTNER. I THINK THE
EVENTS OF THE PAST TEN DAYS HAVE
MADE THAT VERY CLEAR. WE'VE BEEN
CONSISTENT ABOUT THIS NEED FOR
CHOICE FOR THE WHOLE HISTORY OF
AWS, AND THAT'S THE APPROACH
THAT WE CLEARLY LAID OUT WHEN WE
STARTED TALKING ABOUT OUR
GENERATIVE AI STRATEGY ALMOST A
YEAR AGO. AND THAT'S WHY WE
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE, TO MAKE
BUILDING AND MOVING BETWEEN A
RANGE OF FOUNDATION MODELS AS
EASY AS AN API CALL. TODAY
BEDROCK PROVIDES ACCESS TO A
WIDE RANGE OF MODELS FROM
LEADERS LIKE I. 21 ANTHROPIC
COHERE STABILITY AI, AS WELL AS
AMAZON'S OWN AMAZON TITAN MODELS
. BUT WE DIDN'T STOP THERE. WE
WERE THE FIRST TO MAKE METIS
LLAMA 2 MODEL AVAILABLE THROUGH
A FULLY MANAGED API. AND WE ALSO
RECENTLY ANNOUNCED OUR EXPANDED
COLLABORATION WITH ANTHROPIC. SO
ANTHROPIC IS A LONG TIME AWS
CUSTOMER AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S
LEADING FOUNDATION MODEL
PROVIDERS. THEIR MODELS CLAUDE
AND THEY GOT OTHERS AS WELL
EXCEL AT A WIDE RANGE OF TASKS
FROM SOPHISTICATED DIALOG AND
CREATIVE CONTENT GENERATION TO
COMPLEX REASONING AND DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS. SO AS PART OF THE
COLLABORATION, ANTHROPIC IS
GOING TO USE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA TO TRAIN FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF THEIR MODELS AND
BEDROCK CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO
HAVE EARLY ACCESS, NOT AVAILABLE
ON OTHER CLOUDS TO UNIQUE
FEATURES FOR MODEL CUSTOMIZATION
AND FINE TUNING CAPABILITIES. SO
TO DIG IN ON WHAT WE'RE DOING
WITH ANTHROPIC, I'D LIKE TO
BRING OUT OUR PARTNER DARIO
OMODEI, WHO'S THE CEO AND
CO-FOUNDER OF ANTHROPIC. LET'S
GIVE HIM A HAND. AS WELL. ALL
RIGHT. WE HAVE CHAIRS. LET'S SIT
. DARIO THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. YEAH.
EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
CLAUDE IS AVAILABLE ON BEDROCK,
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT,
LET'S JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS ABOUT
AND WHAT MAKES CLAUDE SO UNIQUE.
YES SO ANTHROPIC WAS FOUNDED ON
THE IDEA THAT WE CAN MAKE AI
MODELS THAT ARE SAFE, RELIABLE
AND STEERABLE WHILE STILL BEING
HIGHLY CAPABLE. THE FOUNDERS OF
ANTHROPIC WERE A SET OF PEOPLE
WHO WORKED AT OPENAI FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. WE DEVELOPED IDEAS LIKE
GPT THREE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK, SCALING
LAWS FOR LANGUAGE MODELS. SOME
OF THE KEY IDEAS BEHIND THE
CURRENT GENERATIVE AI BOOM.
SEVEN OF US LEFT AND FOUNDED
ANTHROPIC, OUR FOUNDATION MODEL
CLAUDE. IN ADDITION TO BEING
SAFE AND RELIABLE, EXCELS AT A
LOT OF KNOWLEDGE WORK TASKS LIKE
CONTENT, GENERATION,
SUMMARIZATION, Q&A, COMPLEX
REASONING, THINGS LIKE THAT. WE
HAVE AN INDUSTRY LEADING CONTEXT
WINDOW OF 200 K TOKENS. THAT'S
ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH MAKES
IT WELL SUITED FOR AREAS LIKE
LEGAL FINANCE, INSURANCE,
CODING, THINGS LIKE THAT. AND
ABOUT HALF OF THE FORTUNE 500
ARE USING OR ARE TESTING CLAUDE.
SO AMAZING PROGRESS. SO JUST A
FEW MONTHS AGO, OBVIOUSLY AMAZON
AND ANTHROPIC ANNOUNCED KIND OF
AN ENHANCED STRATEGIC
COLLABORATION ANTHROPIC NAMED
AWS IS YOUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO
BE TRAINING AND DEPLOYING FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF CLAUDE AND
FOUNDATION MODELS ON AWS. SO
JUST TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT LED
UP TO THIS AND HOW THAT
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANTHROPIC
AND AWS GROW? YEAH. SO ANTHROPIC
USE OF AWS GOES BACK TO OUR
EARLY HISTORY BACK ALL THE WAY
IN THE MIDST OF TIME IN 2021. WE
CAN REMEMBER THAT, RIGHT? WE
TRAINED OUR FIRST. WE TRAINED
OUR FIRST MODEL ON AWS. AND SO
WE'RE EXCITED NOW TO SAY THAT
YOU GUYS ARE OUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS. I WOULD SAY THE
PARTNERSHIP HAS THREE
COMPONENTS. FIRST IS THE COMPUTE
SIDE, WHICH I JUST DISCUSSED,
WHICH WE'VE BEEN DOING
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY. THE SECOND IS ON THE
PROVISION TO CUSTOMER SIDE.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT
AMAZON BEDROCK WE REALLY
RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THAT WE
COULD PROVIDE TO CUSTOMERS
WORKING TOGETHER AND THE THIRD
SIDE IS THE HARDWARE. WE'RE
CURRENTLY WORKING WITH YOU GUYS
TO OPTIMIZE THESE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA FOR OUR USE CASES AND
HOPEFULLY FOR OTHER USE CASES.
AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE
CAN ACHIEVE THAT FOREX FASTER
THAN THE FIRST GENERATION
TRAINIUM THAT YOU JUST
ANNOUNCED. IF WE OPTIMIZE THESE
THINGS TOGETHER. AND SO PUTTING
TOGETHER THESE THREE PIECES,
LAYERS OF THE STACK REALLY
ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE THINGS TO
CUSTOMERS TOGETHER THAT COULDN'T
BE PROVIDED BEFORE THINGS LIKE
CUSTOMIZATION OF MODELS USE OF
PROPRIETARY DATA AND UNIQUE FINE
TUNING FEATURES. WELL, IT'S THE
RESPECT WE HAVE FOR YOU GUYS IS
JUST TREMENDOUS. I MEAN, TRULY
WORLD CLASS EXPERTISE FOR THE
ANTHROPIC TEAM. I'VE REALLY
ENJOYED WORKING TOGETHER AND THE
MODELS ARE JUST SO POWERFUL. SO
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE AIMING TO AND I
THINK WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
IMPROVING AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES THROUGH
THIS COLLABORATION. TITAN AND OF
COURSE OUR OWN AMAZON DEVELOPERS
ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO ANTHROPIC
MODELS ON BEDROCK AND THROUGHOUT
THE COMPANY. AND WE'RE NOT ONLY
WORKING TO PROVIDE HOOD
CUSTOMERS WITH, WITH, WITH THIS,
BUT WE'RE GIVING THEM EARLY
ACCESS TO UNIQUE FEATURES THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
GET ANYWHERE ELSE. AND WE'RE OUT
THERE TOGETHER WITH OUR
GENERATIVE AI INNOVATION CENTER,
WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE
FIELD, HELPING THEM TO ACTUALLY
GET GET TARGETED. AND THAT'S
ALLOWING US, OF COURSE, TO BRING
THIS EXPERTISE AND THE DOMAIN
SPECIFIC EXPERTISE THAT THEY
NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS.
AND AS WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE
TOGETHER AND IT'S BEEN HOT AND
HEAVY, PARTICULARLY THE PAST FEW
WEEKS, BUT BEFORE THAT AS WELL,
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST
INTERESTING USE CASES THAT
YOU'VE SEEN? YEAH SO I'LL GIVE
THREE EXAMPLES ACROSS DIFFERENT
INDUSTRIES. THERE'S MANY OTHERS,
BUT THIS SHOULD GIVE GIVE A
SENSE OF THE RANGE. AND WE WE'VE
SEEN A LOT OF ORGANIC ADOPTION.
ONE EXAMPLE IN THE BIOMEDICAL
SPACE WE'RE HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE
WE'RE WORKING WITH PFIZER. I'M A
FORMER BIOLOGIST MYSELF, SO I'M
REALLY EXCITED FOR ANY WAY I CAN
CAN ADVANCE MEDICAL SCIENCE AND
BRING BRING LIFE SAVING DRUGS TO
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND THE
LEGAL SPACE. WE MADE A CUSTOM
FINE TUNED MODEL, DEPLOYED IT TO
YOU GUYS FOR LEXISNEXIS TO HELP
WITH THEIR LEGAL SEARCH. YOU
KNOW, IN A WAY THAT'S KIND OF
FACT BASED AND PRODUCE CITATIONS
. AND IN THE FINANCE SPACE,
WE'RE WORKING WITH BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES TO DEVELOP AN
INVESTMENT ANALYST, ASSISTANT.
BUT BEYOND THAT, JUST SOME
EXAMPLES. WE'VE ENGAGED WITH
SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF SOME OF THE
LARGEST PLAYERS IN THE INSURANCE
AND BANKING INDUSTRIES AND, YOU
KNOW, COULD TELL SIMILAR STORIES
ABOUT OTHER INDUSTRIES. SO, YOU
KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE
NEW USE CASES AND WHERE ALL OF
THIS GOES. THAT'S INCREDIBLE
MOMENTUM. JUST THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES EXAMPLE TO BE WORKING
WITH WITH THAT MANY LEADERS. SO
JUST LAST WEEK YOU'RE NOT
STANDING STILL, RIGHT. SO JUST
LAST WEEK YOU ANNOUNCED CLAUDE
2.1. SO THAT'S GOT A WHOLE LOT
OF NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN KEY
CAPABLE CITIES. MAYBE YOU CAN
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.
YEAH. SO CLAUDE 2.1 REALLY IS A
RELEASE THAT'S TARGETED AT
ENTERPRISES. SO A FEW DIFFERENT
FEATURES. ONE IS WE'VE DOUBLED
OUR CONTEXT WINDOW TO 200,000
TOKENS. TOKENS IS A TERM OF ART
IN THE AI SPACE. WHAT IT AMOUNTS
TO IS ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH
IS A RELATIVELY LONG BOOK. AND
SO USE CASES LIKE READING
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, READING AN
ENTIRE LONG BOOK. AND ONE OF MY
FAVORITES, PUTTING MULTIPLE
DOCUMENTS IN THE CONTEXT WINDOW
AND ASKING THE MODEL TO COMPARE
THEM OR INTEGRATE THEM. A SECOND
FEATURE IS THAT WE'VE REDUCED
THE RATE OF SO-CALLED
HALLUCINATIONS, WHICH IS WHEN
MODELS SAY THINGS THAT AREN'T
TRUE TO BY BY ABOUT TWO X WE'VE
SEEN ACROSS THE INDUSTRY A CORE
OBSTACLE TO DEPLOYMENT IN THE
ENTERPRISE WORLD IS PEOPLE ARE
WORRIED THAT MODELS WILL SAY
THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE. NO ONE
HAS PERFECTLY SOLVED THIS
PROBLEM, BUT WE ARE REALLY
LEADING THE WAY IN GETTING MORE
AND MORE REDUCTIONS AND THEN WE
ALSO HAVE SOME BETA FEATURES AS
WE'RE INTRODUCING SYSTEM PROMPTS
FOR TOOL USE AS A BETA FEATURE
AND A DEVELOPER WORKBENCH.
AGAIN, ALL TOOLS TARGETED AT
PEOPLE BUILDING FOR ENTERPRISES.
WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE ALL THE USE
CASES THAT EMERGE FROM THIS. I'M
SPEECHLESS. YES, THAT IS SUCH
INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. YES. I
MEAN, YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU
TALKED ABOUT THE REDUCTION OF
HALLUCINATION, A REALLY
IMPORTANT TOPIC. YOU JUST MORE
BROADLY, I THINK WE SHARE A
BELIEF THAT I SHOULD BE SAFE,
SECURE, RESPONSIBLE AND BENEFIT
SOCIETY. AND WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED
A LOT OF GROUPS AND
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROMOTING
THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT
OF RESPONSIBLE AI IN FACT, I
KEEP BUMPING INTO DARIA AROUND
THE WORLD AT SOME OF THESE
VARIOUS GATHERINGS, WHICH IS
NICE. SO I KNOW THIS IS A
PARTICULAR PASSION OF YOURS. AND
CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT ANTHROPIC WORK IN
THIS AREA? YEAH I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING WE
WERE FOUNDED ON AND THAT WE CARE
ABOUT DEEPLY. WE I WOULD
CATEGORIZE IT INTO TWO AREAS
WHERE WE'VE DONE WORK IN THIS
AREA. ONE IS THE WAY WE DESIGN
OUR OWN MODELS AND THE OTHER IS
THE WAY THAT WE TRY TO SET AN
EXAMPLE FOR THE ECOSYSTEM AND
BRING OTHERS ALONG SO THAT
ULTIMATELY EVERYONE BECOMES
SAFER AND MORE RELIABLE. SO
LARGE FRACTION ON THE FIRST ONE,
A LARGE FRACTION OF OUR RESEARCH
ORG WORKS ON SAFETY. WE PUT A
LOT OF WORK INTO MAKING OUR
MODELS HARD TO BREAK, MAKING
THEM SECURE AGAINST MISUSE AND
HARMFUL USE. THERE WAS A RECENT
STUDY OUT OF CARNEGIE MELLON
WHERE PEOPLE TRIED TO
ADVERSARIALLY BREAK DIFFERENT
MODELS AND IT FOUND THAT THEY
WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY BREAK
CLAUDE TEN TIMES LESS OFTEN THAN
THEY WERE ABLE TO BREAK THE
COMPETITOR'S MODEL. SO THERE'S A
REAL DIFFERENCE HERE. A SECOND
WE'VE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO
INTERPRETABILITY SEEING INSIDE
THE MODELS. THERE'S NO
COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENTS ON THAT
SO FAR. BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG ARC
AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT RELATIVELY
SOON FOR BOTH COMPLIANCE AND FOR
UNDERSTANDING WHAT MODELS DO AND
THEREFORE REDUCING BAD BEHAVIOR
FROM THE MODELS, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE
WIDER ECOSYSTEM. YOU KNOW, WE
ALWAYS TRY TO CREATE A RACE TO
THE TOP, DO SOMETHING, AND THEN
COMPETITORS, OTHER PLAYERS IN
THE ECOSYSTEM, FOLLOW ALONG AND
DO THE SAME THING. AN EXAMPLE OF
THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE SCALING
POLICY WHERE WE FRONT LOADED
SAFETY INVESTMENT AHEAD OF MODEL
SCALING, A KIND OF
PRE-DEPLOYMENT TESTING REGIME
LIKE WHAT'S DONE FOR CARS AND
AIRPLANES. AND IN THE POLICY
SPACE, WE'VE CONTINUALLY
ADVOCATED FOR GOVERNMENTS TO
BUILD UP THEIR ABILITY TO
EVALUATE AND MEASURE AI SYSTEMS
AS IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO EVALUATE
AND MEASURE THINGS, WE'LL GET
EITHER NO REGULATION OR POORLY
INFORMED REGULATION. WE NEED TO
ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE CAN DEVELOP QUICKLY,
RESPONSIBLY, BUT IN A WAY THAT'S
SECURE. I JUST LOVE THE CONCEPT
OF THE RACE TO THE TOP. IT'S SO
POSITIVE. AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS SO AMAZING. I MEAN, WE'VE
SAID IT THE WHOLE 17 YEARS THAT
AWS HAS BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES
THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT GIVES US
ENERGY IS JUST WORKING WITH THE
COOLEST, MOST CUTTING EDGE, YOU
KNOW, STARTUPS AND ENTREPRENEURS
IN THE WORLD. AND THERE IS JUST
NO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN GENERATIVE AI NOW.
AND WHAT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS
DOING. SO IT'S GREAT TO BE
PARTNERING TOGETHER SO DEEPLY
AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
JOINING ME HERE ON STAGE TODAY.
YEAH, EXCITED FOR EVERYTHING WE
CAN DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU. ALL
RIGHT.
ALL RIGHTY. SO THAT'S AMAZING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN, DARIA,
FOR COMING OUT AND JOINING US.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. SO THE
INNOVATION AROUND GENERATIVE AI
MODELS IS EXPLOSIVE AND WE
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
WITH ALL OF OUR BEDROCK PARTNERS
FOR YEARS TO COME. INCREDIBLY
INNOVATIVE SPACE. AND WE'RE ALSO
EXCITED ABOUT THE LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS THAT WE'RE BUILDING
OURSELVES AT AMAZON SO OUR
AMAZON TITAN MODELS WERE CREATED
AND PRE-TRAINED BY AWS, AND
WE'RE BUILDING OUR OWN MODELS IN
ORDER TO BRING ACTUALLY A FEW
BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS. SO WE DO
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE HERE. I
MEAN, AMAZON HAS BEEN WORKING ON
AI FOR 25 YEARS. I'VE GOT A LONG
TRACK RECORD. WE USE THE
TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR BUSINESS
AND WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
BUILDING AND DEPLOYING MODELS.
AND AS A RESULT, WE CAN PROVIDE
A WHOLE RANGE OF MODELS THAT
OFFER REALLY POWERFUL
CAPABILITIES AND ALSO GREAT
ECONOMICS TO SUPPORT A WHOLE
BUNCH OF USE CASES AND WE
CAREFULLY CHOOSE HOW WE TRAIN
OUR MODELS AND THE DATA THAT WE
USE TO DO SO. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY
GOING TO INDEMNIFY CUSTOMERS
AGAINST CLAIMS THAT OUR MODELS
OR THEIR OUTPUTS INFRINGE ON
ANYBODY'S COPYRIGHT. NOW, THERE
ARE ALREADY MULTIPLE MODELS IN
THE TITAN FAMILY. WE'VE GOT
TITAN TEXT LITE, WHICH IS IDEAL
FOR TEXT BASED TASKS LIKE
SUMMARIZATION. WE'VE ALSO GOT
TITAN TEXT EXPRESS, WHICH IS
GREAT FOR MORE ADVANCED GENERAL
LANGUAGE TASKS LIKE COPY
EDITING, COPYWRITING AND WE'VE
ALSO GOT THE TITAN TEXT
EMBEDDINGS MODEL FOR SEARCH USE
CASES OR PERSONALIZATION AND
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ADDING
MODELS TO THE TITAN FAMILY. AND
IF YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT, THEN
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TUNE INTO
SWAMI'S KEYNOTE TOMORROW. A
LITTLE, LITTLE WORD UP NOW, ALL
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE
ALL EXTREMELY CAPABLE AND THEY
ALL ENABLE A LOT OF GREAT
APPLICATIONS. BUT TO REALLY
DRIVE YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED
GENERATIVE AI THAT UNDERSTANDS
YOUR BUSINESS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
CUSTOMERS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
PRODUCTS, YOUR OPERATIONS. AND
THAT'S ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN YOU
USE YOUR OWN DATA TO IMPROVE AND
CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS. THE MODELS
HAVE TO BECOME UNIQUE TO YOU. SO
AMAZON BEDROCK IS GIVING YOU ALL
OF THE PURPOSE BUILT
CAPABILITIES THAT YOU NEED TO
CUSTOMIZE THE AI APPLICATIONS
WITH YOUR OWN DATA. SO WITH A
FEW CLICKS YOU CAN GO FROM
GENERIC APPLICATIONS TO ONES
THAT ARE HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND
HIGHLY TAILORED. SO ONE
IMPORTANT TECHNIQUE IS CALLED
FINE TUNING. NOW, WITH FINE
TUNING, YOU POINT THE MODELS TO
EXAMPLES OF DATA IN S3 THAT
YOU'VE LABELED LABELED TO
PROVIDE CONTEXT. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU MIGHT POINT TO PROPOSALS AND
YOU'VE LABELED SOME OF THOSE
PROPOSALS AS STRONG. SO IN THIS
WAY THE MODEL LEARNS FROM YOU,
LEARNS FROM YOUR DATA. WHAT
MATTERS THE MOST TO YOU. AND
THEN BEDROCK MAKES A COPY OF THE
BASE MODELS. IT TRAINS IT, IT
CREATES A PRIVATE FINE TUNED
MODEL SO YOU GET TAILORED
RESPONSES. SO FINE TUNING IS
AVAILABLE IN AMAZON TITAN TEXT
LITE AND EXPRESS, AND TODAY IT'S
ALSO GENERALLY AVAILABLE FOR
COHERE COMMAND LITE AND META
LLAMA 2 AND FINE TUNING IS
COMING TO ANTHROPIC CLAUDE SOON.
SO A SECOND TECHNIQUE FOR
TAILORING TAILORING FOUNDATION
MODELS FOR YOUR BUSINESS IS
CALLED RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED
GENERATION OR RAG ANOTHER ONE OF
THE TERMS YOU SEE OUT THERE A
LOT. SO RAG ALLOWS YOU TO
CUSTOMIZE A MODEL'S RESPONSES
WHEN YOU WANT THE MODEL TO
CONSIDER NEW KNOWLEDGE OR UP TO
DATE INFORMATION. SO BEDROCK
DOES THIS FOR YOU BY CALLING AND
BRINGING BACK YOUR OWN DATA,
YOUR DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES,
INCLUDING DOCUMENT REPOSITORIES,
DATABASES AND OTHER APIS AND
MORE SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MODEL
MIGHT USE RAG TO RETRIEVE SEARCH
RESULTS FROM OUR AMAZON
OPENSEARCH SERVICE OR DOCUMENTS
FROM S3. AND IN SEPTEMBER, WE
INTRODUCED A RAG CAPABILITY
CALLED KNOWLEDGE BASES THAT
CONNECTS FM TO YOUR PROPRIETARY
DATA SOURCES TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR
PROMPTS WITH MORE INFORMATION
AND TODAY KNOWLEDGE BASES IS
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NOW, A
THIRD WAY THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE
MODELS INSIDE OF BEDROCK IS A
TECHNIQUE CALLED CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING. SO CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT
USES LARGE AMOUNTS OF UNLABELED
DATA BEFORE YOU FINE TUNE IT.
YOU DID THE LABELED DATA HERE IS
UNLABELED DATA LIKE THE RAW TEXT
OF INTERNAL REPORTS, FINANCIAL
PLANS OR RESEARCH RESULTS THAT
YOU HAVE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE
USED TO IMPROVE THE MODELS,
KNOWLEDGE AND ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES USING THINGS IN
YOUR OWN SPECIFIC DOMAIN. SO
CONTINUED PRE-TRAINING IS OF
COURSE AVAILABLE IN BEDROCK
TODAY. NOW ALL OF THESE
TECHNIQUES, THEY'RE ALL POWERFUL
TOOLS IN MAKING GENERATIVE AI
TARGETED, MAKING IT TRULY USEFUL
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND BEDROCK
MAKES IT REALLY EASY TO COMBINE
THESE TECHNIQUES TOGETHER. SO A
GREAT EXAMPLE OF A CUSTOMER
USING BEDROCK TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR
GENERATIVE AI AI APPLICATIONS IS
DELTA AIRLINES. SO DELTA IS
ACTUALLY MODERNIZING ITS
CUSTOMER SERVICE CAPABILITY WITH
GENERATIVE AI AI BUILT ON AMAZON
BEDROCK. THE NEW TOOL IS GOING
TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS IN A MORE RELEVANT AND
CONVERSATIONAL STYLE BY
ACCESSING DELTA'S TRAVEL
POLICIES, REAL TIME FLIGHT
SCHEDULES, CUSTOMER REBOOKING
OPTIONS AND AIRPORT CONDITIONS.
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD
RESPOND TO SIMPLE QUESTIONS LIKE
HOW MANY BAGS CAN I CHECK ON A
DELTA FLIGHT? AND IT CAN ALSO DO
MORE COMPLEX QUESTIONS LIKE CAN
I CARRY MY CAT WITH ME IN THE
CABIN TO JAMAICA? OF COURSE.
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH YOUR CAT?
DELTA'S BEEN
TESTING WITH DIFFERENT
FOUNDATION MODELS IN BEDROCK,
INCLUDING ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 2.0
CLAUDE INSTANT AND A FINE TUNED
AMAZON TITAN TEXT EXPRESS MODEL.
AND THIS WAY THEY CAN USE THE
RIGHT MODEL TO ANSWER DIFFERENT
CUSTOMER QUESTIONS IN. IT'S A
REALLY POWERFUL HOW THEY CAN
COMBINE THE MOST RELEVANT
INFORMATION NEEDED TO ANSWER ANY
SPECIFIC QUESTION. NOW, WITH THE
NEW CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOL
DELTA AIRLINES IS AIMING TO
PROVIDE A DELIGHTFUL AND
CONVERSATIONAL SELF-SERVICE
EXPERIENCE AND IT'S GOING TO
IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SO
EVERYONE WANTS MORE RELEVANT
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS,
RIGHT? AND BEDROCK IS MAKING IT
A LOT EASIER TO CUSTOMIZE THOSE
APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR OWN DATA.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU
WANT FMS TO DO MORE THAN JUST
PROVIDE USEFUL AND TARGETED
INFORMATION AND ULTIMATELY WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT IS TO USE
FMS TO TAKE ACTION TO ACTUALLY
GET THINGS DONE AND WE WANTED
YOU TO BE ABLE TO USE BEDROCK TO
COMPLETE ACTIONS LIKE BOOKING
TRAVEL, FILING INSURANCE CLAIMS,
DEPLOYING SOFTWARE, MAYBE
ORDERING REPLACEMENT PARTS. AND
THIS USUALLY REQUIRES
ORCHESTRATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE
SYSTEMS THAT OPERATE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S WHY A
FEW MONTHS AGO, WE INTRODUCED
AGENTS FOR BEDROCK. AND TODAY
I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS
POWERFUL FEATURE IS TODAY.
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. NOW WITH
AGENTS GENAI APPLICATIONS CAN
EXECUTE MULTI-STEP TASKS ACROSS
COMPANY SYSTEMS AND DATA SOURCES
FROM ANSWERING CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS ABOUT PRODUCT
AVAILABLE IOT TO TAKING A SALES
ORDER AND MORE AND BUILDING WITH
AGENTS IS REALLY EASY. FIRST,
YOU USE BEDROCK SETUP WIZARD TO
SELECT THE APPROPRIATE MODEL.
THEN YOU GIVE THE MODEL BASIC
INSTRUCTIONS TO HELP THE MODEL
UNDERSTAND HOW TO RESPOND. LIKE
YOU ARE A FRIENDLY CUSTOMER
SERVICE AGENT WHO HELPS
CUSTOMERS RETURN ITEMS. NEXT,
YOU SPECIFY THE LAMBDA FUNCTIONS
THAT EXECUTE THE API CALLS TO
RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION THAT'S
RELEVANT TO THE TASK. FOR
EXAMPLE, RETURN POLICIES OR
INVENTORY LEVELS. AND FINALLY,
YOU SELECT THE DATA SOURCES.
THEN YOU JUST SELECT, CREATE
AGENT AND BEDROCK, CONFIGURES
YOUR AGENT AND IT IS NOW READY
TO RUN WHEN THE AGENT RECEIVES A
REQUEST, IT USES ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES TO ANALYZE AND TO
PLAN THE TASK. AND THE MODEL
WORKS OUT THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS.
THE INFORMATION NEEDED, THE APIS
TO CALL AND WHEN TO CALL THEM.
THEN IT EXECUTE BETZ THE PLAN,
TAKING ALL THE STEPS THAT IT
NEEDS TO GATHER THE INFORMATION
AND THEN COMPLETE THE TASK. ALL
IN THE BACKGROUND. NO NEED TO
ENGINEER PROMPT, NO NEED TO
TRAIN THE FMS. NO NEED TO
MANUALLY CONNECT SYSTEMS WITH
AGENTS. GENERATIVE AI IS
BECOMING AN INTEGRAL PART OF
YOUR BUSINESS. MAKING IT EASY TO
TAKE ACTIONS AND GET TASKS DONE.
NO HEAVY LIFTING REQUIRED SO
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW BEDROCK
IS MAKING IT EASY TO CHOOSE
AMONGST LEADING MODELS AND ALSO
HOW IT GIVES YOU SO MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA AND HOW IT CAN
HELP COMBINE THE POWER OF MODELS
INTO YOUR ORGANIZATION'S
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA'S AND YOUR
API TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION. BUT
YOU WON'T ACTUALLY USE ANY OF
THIS IN A SERIOUS WAY IF IT
ISN'T SECURE AND PRIVATE.
I MEAN, YOU DEMAND THE
SAME ROCK SOLID RELIABILITY. THE
SAME SECURITY FOR GENERATIVE AI
THAT YOU DO FOR ANY WORKLOAD,
AND YOU REALLY NEED THIS TO HAVE
NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS
THAN EVERYTHING YOU EXPECT FROM
AN AWS SERVICE. IT'S JUST LIKE
S3. EC2. RDS. BEDROCK HAS GOT TO
HAVE ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
FEATURES TO MAKE YOUR DATA SAFE
AND PRIVATE, AND THAT'S WHAT IT
HAS. BEDROCK CUSTOMERS CAN TRUST
THAT THEIR DATA REMAINS
PROTECTED. NO CUSTOMER DATA IS
GOING TO BE USED TO TRAIN OR
IMPROVE THE ORIGINAL BASE
MODELS. WHEN YOU TUNE A MODEL,
WE MAKE A PRIVATE COPY OF THAT
MODEL. WE PUT IT IN A SECURE
CONTAINER AND IT GOES NOWHERE.
YOUR DATA IS NEVER EXPOSED TO
THE PUBLIC INTERNET, NEVER
LEAVES THE AWS NETWORK. IT'S
SECURELY TRANSFERRED THROUGH
YOUR VPC. IT'S ENCRYPTED IN
TRANSIT AND AT REST AND BEDROCK
ENFORCES THE SAME AWS ACCESS
CONTROLS YOU HAVE WITH ANY OF
OUR OTHER SERVICES AS BEDROCK
ALSO SUPPORTS A VARIETY OF
REGULATORY STANDARDS. IT'S HIPAA
ELIGIBLE. IT CAN BE USED IN
COMPLIANCE WITH GDPR. WE'VE
ADDED A BUNCH OF OTHER SECURITY
AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITIES,
INCLUDING INTEGRATIONS WITH
CLOUDWATCH TO TRACK USAGE AND
METRICS. CLOUDTRAIL TO MONITOR
API ACTIVITY AND TROUBLESHOOT
ACTIVITY. AND TODAY BEDROCK IS
SOC COMPLIANT. NOW THIS HELPS A
CUSTOMER ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS
CAN HAVE STRONG CONTROLS AND
POLICIES IN PLACE AND HELPS IT
BE USED IN EVERY BUSINESS. NOW,
BEYOND SECURITY, WE NEED
GENERATIVE AI TO BE DEPLOYED IN
A SAFE, TRUSTWORTHY AND RESPONSE
ABLE FASHION. LIKE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND
THAT'S OUR NORTH STAR FOR THE
CAPABILITIES THAT MAKE GENAI
SUCH A PROMISING TOOL FOR
INNOVATION. ALSO, DO INCREASE
THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE. WE'VE
GOT TO FIND WAYS TO UNLOCK
GENERATIVE AI AI'S FULL
POTENTIAL WHILE MITIGATING THE
RISKS. NOW, DEALING WITH THIS
CHALLENGE IS GOING TO REQUIRE
UNPRECEDENTED COLLABORATION AND
A TRULY MULTI-STAKEHOLDER EFFORT
ACROSS TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES,
POLICY MAKERS, COMMUNITY GROUPS,
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES AND
ACADEMICS. WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATING IN A LOT OF THE
GROUPS THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER
TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES EARLIER
THIS YEAR, I JOINED PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS
LIKE DARIO AS HE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'VE MADE A SERIES OF VOLUNTARY
COMMITMENTS TO PROMOTING THE
SAFE, THE SECURE AND THE
TRANSPARENT DEVELOPMENT OF AI
TECHNOLOGY. AND JUST THIS MONTH,
I JOINED A UK PRIME MINISTER
SUNAK, FOR HIS AI SAFETY SUMMIT
TO DISCUSS NEW APPROACHES,
INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF THEIR
NEW AI SAFETY INSTITUTE. NOW AN
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF
RESPONSIBLE AI IS PROMOTING THE
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOUR
CONSUMERS AND THE APPLICATIONS
THAT ARE SAFE THAT AVOID HARMFUL
OUTPUTS AND THAT STAY WITHIN
YOUR COMPANY'S GUIDELINES. AND
THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO
ACTUALLY PLACE LIMITS ON WHAT
INFORMATION THE MODELS CAN AND
CAN'T RETURN. AND WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD HERE, AND TODAY
WE'RE ANNOUNCING GUARDRAILS FOR
AMAZON BEDROCK. NOW THIS IS A
NEW CAPABILITY THAT HELPS YOU
EASILY SAFEGUARD YOUR GENERATIVE
AI APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR
RESPONSIBLE AI POLICIES TO
CREATE A GUARDRAIL. BEDROCK
PROVIDES CONFIGURATION WIZARD SO
YOU CAN ENTER A NATURAL LANGUAGE
DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPICS THAT
YOU WANT. THE MODEL TO AVOID.
GUARDRAILS CAN BE USED WITH ANY
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS
ACCESSIBLE VIA BEDROCK,
INCLUDING THE CUSTOM MODELS THAT
YOU CREATE THROUGH YOUR OWN FINE
TUNING AND YOU CAN ALSO USE
GUARDRAILS WITH AGENTS. SO NOW
YOU CAN HAVE A CONSISTENT LEVEL
OF PROTECTION ACROSS ALL OF YOUR
GENAI GENAI DEVELOPMENT
ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, A BANK
COULD CONFIGURE AN ONLINE
ASSISTANT TO REFRAIN FROM
PROVIDING INVESTMENT ADVICE OR
TO PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT
. AN E COMMERCE SITE COULD
ENSURE THAT ITS ONLINE ASSISTANT
DOESN'T USE HATE SPEECH OR
INSULTS OR A UTILITY COMPANY
COULD REMOVE PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR PII
FROM A CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL
SUMMARY. SO WE'RE APPROACHING
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF GENERATIVE
AI IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT
WAY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT
IT TAKES TO REINVENT. HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO BUILD WITH THIS
TECHNOLOGY? WE JUST, AS YOU'VE
USED AWS TO REINVENT HOW YOU'VE
BUILT AND INNOVATE IT FOR YEARS
AND ULTIMATELY TO TRANSFORM HOW
YOUR ORGANIZATION OPERATES,
WHETHER YOU'RE MIGRATING
ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS,
BUILDING THE NEXT HOT STARTUP OR
OR DEPLOYING YOUR GENERATIVE AI
STRATEGY. OUR APPROACH REMAINS
THE SAME. UM, CUSTOMER
OBSESSION, INNOVATION AND A LONG
TERM VIEW OF WHAT JOINT SUCCESS
REALLY MEANS. TO TELL US MORE
ABOUT HOW HER COMPANY IS BUILT
ON AWS AND IS NOW REINVENTING
WITH GENERATIVE AI, PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE LIDIA
FONSECA, THE CHIEF DIGITAL AND
TECHNICAL OFFICER OF PFIZER.
THANK EVERYBODY. I'D LIKE TO
START BY ASKING HOW MANY
PATIENTS DO YOU THINK PFIZER
TREATED LAST YEAR? YOU MAY BE
THINKING IN THE MILLIONS, BUT IN
FACT WE TREATED 1.3 BILLION
PATIENTS WITH OUR MEDICINES AND
VACCINES. THAT'S ONE OUT OF SIX
HUMANS ON THE PLANET. A TRULY
HUMBLING, ACCOMPLISHED AGENT.
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE
RECOGNIZED AS AN INNOVATIVE AND
ETHICAL COMPANY LISTED IN
FORTUNE'S WORLD'S MOST ADMIRED
COMPANIES. FORBES WORLD'S BEST
EMPLOYERS, AND TIME MAGAZINE'S
WORLD'S BEST COMPANIES, PFIZER
IS EXPERIENCING AN EXCITING
PERIOD OF INNOVATION AND GROWTH
WITH THE LAUNCH OF 90 MEDICINES
AND VACCINES IN 18 MONTHS. THIS
HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BY US OR ANY
OTHER PHARMA COMPANY. IT IS AN
INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS GOAL AND WE
ARE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 13
ALREADY LAUNCHED DIGITAL DATA
AND AI ARE CRITICAL TO OUR
SUCCESS. AS AND WHAT
DIFFERENTIATES PFIZER IS THAT WE
APPLY THIS ACROSS ALL BUSINESS
UNITS. OUR 36 PLANTS AND THE 149
MARKETS THAT WE SERVE QUICKLY
AND AT SCALE TO BRING MEDICINES
TO PATIENTS FASTER. OUR SUCCESS
TODAY RESTS ON THE GROUNDWORK WE
LAID FOR TECHNOLOGY AND AI TO
FLOURISH. CENTRAL IZING OUR
DATA, CREATE STANDARD PLATFORMS,
CULTIVATING STRONG TALENT AND
BUILDING A SECURE FOUNDATION IN
ALL TO INNOVATE FOR MAXIMUM
IMPACT. WE COULD NOT HAVE
ACHIEVED THIS TREMENDOUS REACH
WITHOUT OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
WITH AWS. SO LET ME SHARE A BIT
ABOUT OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER. IN
2019 PFIZER AND AWS CREATED A
PIONEERING SCIENCE DATA CLOUD
THAT AGGREGATES MULTIMODAL DATA
FROM HUNDREDS OF LABORATORY
INSTRUMENTS, EMPOWERING OUR
SCIENTISTS TO SEARCH ALL
HISTORICAL MOLECULE AND COMPOUND
DATA IN REAL TIME COMPARED TO
WEEKS OR MONTHS IN OUR PRIOR
FRAGMENTED ENVIRONMENT AND THE
SCIENTIFIC DATA CLOUD
ACCELERATES ANALYSIS AND
COMPUTATION OF RESEARCH AND WITH
AI ALGORITHMS THAT HELP US
IDENTIFY AND DESIGN THE MOST
PROMISING NEW MOLECULES IS
BUILDING ON THAT SUCCESS IN
2021. PFIZER EMBARKED ON ONE OF
OUR BOLDEST INITIATIVE IS GOING
FROM 10% OF OUR CORE IN THE TO
CLOUD 80% MOVING IN 12,000
APPLICATIONS AND 8000 SERVERS IN
42 WEEKS. ONE OF THE FASTEST
MIGRATIONS FOR A COMPANY OUR
SIZE. THIS MOVE TO AWS SAVED US
$47 MILLION A YEAR AND HELPED US
EXIT THREE DATA CENTERS,
REDUCING 4700 TONS OF CO2
EMISSIONS OR THE EQUIVALENT
ENERGY USE BY 1000 HOMES IN A
YEAR. BUT VERY IMPORTANT ALI. IT
ENABLED US TO INNOVATE WITH
SPEED AND AT SCALE. FOR EXAMPLE,
WE REDUCED TIME TO SET UP
COMPUTING CAPACITY FROM MONTHS
TO HOURS, SPEEDING UP DATA
GENERATION FOR DRUG SUBMISSIONS
BY. 75. AND WHEN COVID HIT, AWS
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO OFFER
THEIR HELP, SCALING US INTO THE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL
CORES IN THE CLOUD AND
ACCELERATING MANUFACTURING AND
CLINICAL TRIALS. WHEN WE RAN
COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE
ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO
MANUFACTURE OUR COVID VACCINE,
AWS JUMPED IN WITH ADDITIONAL
CPUS FOR US TO MOVE FAST. AND
WHEN WE NEEDED TO SUBMIT DATA TO
THE FDA IN UNDER A DAY,
INCREASED OUR CAPACITY IN
ENABLING PFIZER TO MOVE AT THE
SPEED OF SCIENCE. IN FACT, IT
TOOK JUST 269 DAYS FROM WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED OUR PLANS TO DEVELOP A
COVID 19 VACCINE WITH BIONTECH
TO THE DAY THAT WE RECEIVED THE
FDA'S EMERGENCY USE
AUTHORIZATION ACTION. THIS
NORMALLY TAKES 8 TO 10 YEARS.
THANK YOU. WITH THE WORLD
WAITING, WE NEEDED TO
MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE THE
VACCINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
WE HELD FIRM TO OUR MANTRA
SCIENCE WILL WIN. WELL WHILE
SCIENCE DID WIN AND DIGITAL
HELPED US DO IT FASTER, PFIZER
OUR INDUSTRY LEADING DIGITAL
OPERATIONS CENTER ALLOWED US
COLLEAGUES TO SEE PRODUCTION
STATUS ACROSS PLANTS AND RESOLVE
ISSUES IN REAL TIME, YIELDING A
20% THROUGHPUT INCREASE. OUR
MRNA PREDICTION ALGORITHM
YIELDED 20,000 MORE VACCINE
DOSES PER BATCH. IMAGINE THE
LIVES IMPACT IT. TO GIVE YOU AN
IDEA OF THE SCALE, PRIOR TO
COVID, PFIZER PRODUCED 220
MILLION VACCINE DOSES IN TOTAL
AND SCALED TO 4 BILLION OF
COMMUNITY IN 2022. THIS IS NOW
AT THE HEART OF HOW OUR PLANTS
OPERATE, AND WE'RE APPLYING
THESE INNOVATIONS TO THE TO OUR
OTHER MEDICINES AND VACCINES.
MORE RECENTLY, AWS HELPED US
APPLY AI TO GENERATE ALERTS
ABOUT POTENTIAL SUPPLY CHAIN
DISRUPTIONS, PROMPTING US TO
REROUTE SHIPMENTS TO CONTINUE
DELIVERING MEDICINES TO CLINICAL
TRIAL SITES AHEAD OF HURRICANE
IAN'S LANDFALL. DIGITAL AI MADE
IT POSSIBLE FOR PFIZER TO BRING
MEDICINES TO PATIENTS AROUND THE
GLOBE FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE.
NOW LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S NEXT.
AS YOU HEARD, PFIZER HAS BEEN
HARNESSING AI TO DRIVE
INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY ON A
GLOBAL SCALE. AND MORE RECENTLY,
WE ARE LEVERAGING GENERATIVE AI,
WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO DELIVER
ANNUAL COST SAVINGS OF 750
MILLION TO $1 BILLION IN THE
NEAR TERM. SOME REAL TANGIBLE
VALUE TO USING AWS CLOUD
SERVICES. PFIZER QUICKLY
DEPLOYED FOX OUR INTERNAL
GENERATIVE AI PLATFORM ALLOWING
COLLEAGUES TO ACCESS LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS AVAILABLE IN
AMAZON BEDROCK AND SAGEMAKER AWS
BREADTH OF SERVICES AND THE
VARIETY OF LMS IN BEDROCK MEANS
WE CAN SELECT THE BEST TOOLS FOR
USE CASES IN R&D, MANUFACTURE,
MARKETING AND MORE ENABLING
PFIZER AND AWS TO PROTOTYPE 17
DIFFERENT USE CASES IN A MATTER
OF WEEKS. I IN GENERATIVE AI
WILL HELP US IDENTIFY NEW
ONCOLOGY TARGETS, A PROCESS THAT
IS LARGELY MANUAL TODAY WITH AI,
WE CAN SEARCH AND COLLATE
RELEVANT DATA AND SCIENTIFIC
CONTENT FROM MANY MORE SOURCES
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME AND
ALGORITHMS GENERATE AND VALIDATE
POTENTIAL TARGETS TO IMPROVE OUR
SCIENTIFIC SUCCESS WITH BEDROCK,
WE CAN SCAN THE MARKETPLACE FOR
COMPANIES AND ASSETS AUTOMATING
THE CREATION OF COMPANY PROFILES
TO PRIORITIZE POTENTIAL
ACQUISITION ROLES IN
MANUFACTURING. BEDROCK TAKES THE
OPTIMAL PROCESS PARAMETERS TO
IDENTIFY WHAT WE CALL THE GOLDEN
BATCH AND USES GENERATIVE AI TO
DETECT ANOMALIES AND RECOMMEND
ACTIONS TO OUR OPERATORS IN REAL
TIME. AIMING TO IMPROVE CYCLE
TIME BY 25% AWS IS AGILE CULTURE
ALIGNS WELL WITH PFIZER'S
LIGHTSAIL LEAD WAY OF WORKING.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING ON
OUR LEARNINGS TO UNDERSTAND AND
NOT JUST HOW AI CAN TRANSFORM
OUR DAILY WORK, BUT HOW IT MAY
HELP US DISRUPT THE INDUSTRY.
ORI TO CLOSE, WE'RE EXCITED TO
ACCELERATE OUR BATTLE AGAINST
CANCER. WITH PFIZER'S PROPOSED
ACQUISITION OF CDN, A BIOTECH
FOCUSED ON CANCER THERAPY. AS WE
PLAN TO BRING JENS LEADING EDGE
ANTIBODY DRUG CONJUGATE
TECHNOLOGY TO MORE PATIENTS WITH
CANCER, FASTER. YOU SEE, WE HOPE
TO ACHIEVE WITH CANCER WHAT WE
WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH COVID.
OUR WORK WITH THE AWS WILL HELP
US CONTINUE THIS GREAT MOMENTUM
FUELING OUR AMBITION TO CHANGE A
BILLION LIVES EVERY YEAR, NOT
JUST IN A PANDEMIC YEAR. THANK
YOU, AWS FOR HELPING PFIZER
BRING BREAKTHROUGHS TO PATIENTS
FASTER BECAUSE IN THE BATTLE
AGAINST DISEASE, TIME IS LIFE.
THANK YOU ALL. ONE OUT OF EVERY
SIX PEOPLE ON THE PLANET ARE
IMPACTED BY PFIZER. I MEAN, THAT
IS JUST SO IMPRESSIVE. SO
IMPRESSIVE. LYDIA MEANS SO MUCH
TO US, HONESTLY, THAT YOU'VE
TRUSTED AWS TO. TO HELP DELIVER
ALL THESE CAPABILITIES. THESE
BREAKTHROUGHS THAT ARE CHANGING
PEOPLE'S LIVES. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. AND THANK YOU, ADAM AWS
HAS JUST BEEN AN AMAZING
PARTNER. THANK YOU. WE LOOK
FORWARD TO MORE. THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. SO
ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE
ARE USING AWS FOR AGILITY FOR
SPEED AND FOR THE SCALE THAT
THEY NEED TO DRIVE THEIR
FUTURES. BUT THIS REQUIRES
EMPLOYEES WITH TOP NOTCH CLOUD
SKILLS. AND WE KNOW THAT NOT
ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE THAT CLOUD
EXPERTISE AND THAT THERE'S A
LARGE SKILL GAP THAT'S GOT TO BE
CLOSED. SO GENERATIVE AI IS OF
COURSE, THE NEXT INCREDIBLY
EXCITING NEW OPPORTUNITY. BUT
IT'S ONLY GOING TO ADD TO THAT
GAP. AND SO WE'RE INVESTING TO
HELP PROVIDE THE CLOUD SCALE
SKILLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
NEEDED ACROSS THE WORLD FOR
YEARS TO COME. AWS IS COMMITTED
TO TRAINING 29 MILLION PEOPLE
FOR FREE WITH CLOUD COMPUTING
SKILLS BY THE YEAR 2025. AND
WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 21
MILLION ALREADY TRAINED. AND WE
JUST LAUNCHED WE JUST RECENTLY
LAUNCHED THE AWS CLOUD
INSTITUTE, WHICH IS PROVIDING
DEEP CLOUD EXPERTISE TO HELP
STUDENTS LAUNCH AN ENTIRE CLOUD
CAREER. AND WE'VE ALSO LAUNCHED
100 DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING
AND AI COURSES AND RESOURCES TO
SUPPORT INNOVATION AND JUST OVER
A WEEK AGO, WE ANNOUNCED AI
READY, WHICH IS OUR NEW
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE FREE AI
SKILLS TO ANOTHER 2 MILLION
PEOPLE BY 2025 AND TO HELP
STUDENTS AROUND THE WORLD WITH
TO LEARN THE FOUNDATION SKILLS
AND TO PREPARE FOR A CAREER IN
TECH. WE ACTUALLY CREATED AN AI
AND MACHINE LEARNING SCHOLARSHIP
FUND. LET'S MEET SOME OF THE
RECIPIENT. THIS. MY NAME IS
VANIA GAREWAL. MY NAME IS JOSE
TAPIA. MY NAME IS OLYMPIA
OTIENO. WITHOUT THE AI/ML
SCHOLARSHIP, I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP MY OWN
QUESTIONS. KNOW WHAT TOOLS ARE
AVAILABLE TO SOLVE THEM. THE
NANODEGREE IS DEFINITELY
UNLOCKED. MY INTEREST IN AI
CONSTANTLY TRY TO GO OUT THERE
AND TALK TO GIRLS WHO ARE
CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN
LIFE IN KENYA DUE TO CROP
DISEASE WIZ THE RATES AT WHICH
THE YIELDS HAVE BEEN DROPPING IS
DEVASTATING. SO MY COLLEAGUES
AND I HAVE MADE A MOBILE
APPLICATION WITH AI FARMERS
PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE CROP
DISEASES. THE FACT THAT I WAS
ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM,
I NOW KNOW THAT I AM CAPABLE OF
DOING WELL IN THIS FIELD. I
MEAN, THIS IS WHY WE DO THIS
STUFF, RIGHT? WHAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE
JOSE AND OLYMPIA HERE WITH US
TODAY. SO COME ON, LET'S GIVE
THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THERE
WE GO. TO BOTH OF YOU. I'M SO
PROUD. I'M REALLY PROUD OF WHAT
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE. AND I JUST
REALLY HOPE THAT REINVENT THIS
WEEK IS JUST A GREAT, GREAT
EXPERIENCE FOR YOU. THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR LETTING US SHARE YOUR
STORIES AND FOR EVERYONE
WATCHING, WE WANT TO EMPOWER ALL
OF YOU TO BUILD AND TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF IMPACT. AND WE SEE A
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THAT BY
INFUSING GENERATIVE AI INTO ALL
OF THE SYSTEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE
USING INTO THEIR DAILY LIVES. WE
BELIEVE THAT GENERATIVE AI
SHOULD HELP EVERYONE AT WORK
SEAMLESSLY WITH HELPFUL,
RELEVANT ASSISTANCE. WHETHER OR
NOT, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST THING
ABOUT FOUNDATION MODELS IS RAG
OR ANY OF THE REST. AND THAT
BRINGS US TO THE TOP OF THE
STACK, THE APPLICATIONS THAT YOU
USE THAT ARE POWERED BY
GENERATIVE AI, LEVERAGING
FOUNDATION MODELS. WE BELIEVE
THAT GENERATIVE AI, OF COURSE,
HAS THE POTENTIAL OVER TIME TO
TRANSFORM VIRTUALLY EVERY
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THAT WE
KNOW. IT CAN POUR THROUGH THE
NOOKS AND CRANNIES OF A SYSTEM
AND ACTUALLY HELP YOU FIND DATA
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
EXISTED. AND THEN HELP YOU PUT
IT TO OPTIMAL USE. IT CAN
GENERATE INSIGHTS THAT CAN SAVE
HOURS OF MANUAL WORK AND IT CAN
TAKE PROJECTS THAT WERE SLOGS
AND MAKE THEM A SNAP. NOW, ONE
IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS HOW
GENERATIVE AI CAN MAKE THE TASK
OF WRITING CODE RADICALLY
FASTER. AND SO LAST YEAR WE
RELEASED AMAZON CODEWHISPERER,
WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD GENERATIVE
AI, WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD
APPLICATIONS, I SHOULD SAY,
FASTER AND MORE SECURELY BY
GENERATING CODE SUGGESTIONS IN
NEAR REAL TIME. NOW WITH
CODEWHISPERER DEVELOPERS USE A
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPT AND THEN
RECEIVE ACCURATE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN EVERY POPULAR IDE
. AND FOR 15 OF THE MOST POPULAR
PROGRAMING LANGUAGES, A
CODEWHISPERER GIVES DEVELOPERS A
POWERFUL BOOST FOR GENERAL CODE
EXAMPLES. AND OF COURSE WE MADE
SURE THAT IT'S GREAT FOR
PROVIDING SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS
FOR CODE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
WARNER MUSIC GROUP, THE
BUNDESLIGA AND THE CIGNA GROUP
HAVE EMBRACED CODEWHISPERER TO
ACCELERATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT
CAPABILITIES, AND TATA
CONSULTANCY SERVICES, AWS,
ACCENTURE AND HCLTECH ARE MAKING
CODEWHISPERER AVAILABLE TO TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES EACH.
NOW COHEN IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN
THE ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR
INDUSTRY. THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT CODEWHISPERER IS A GAME
CHANGER FOR THEM AND WE WANT AS
MANY DEVELOPERS AS POSSIBLE TO
REAP THE BENEFITS. AND SO WHAT
WE'VE DONE IS TO MAKE CODE
WHISPERER, TO MAKE THE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN IT FREE, FREE FOR
INDIVIDUAL USE. NOW THE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CODE
WHISPERS ARE GREAT FOR GENERAL
CODING TASKS, BUT GENERAL CODING
SUGGESTIONS CAN ONLY GET YOUR
DEVELOPERS SO FAR. IMAGINE
YOU'VE JUST HIRED A NEW
DEVELOPER FOR EVEN IF THEY ARE
WORLD CLASS, THEY ARE NOT GOING
TO DO THEIR BEST WORK UNTIL THEY
UNDERSTAND YOUR CODE BASE AND
YOUR INTERNAL BEST PRACTICES. AN
AI POWERED CODING TOOLS ARE
SIMILAR. YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT
TOOL, BUT FOR THE KIND OF SPEED
AND RELEVANCY THAT MAKES THE
MOST DIFFERENCE, YOUR SOLUTION
HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF
YOUR CODE AND THE BEST PLACE TO
FIND THAT CONTEXT IS INSIDE OF
YOUR INTERNAL APIS, YOUR
LIBRARIES AND YOUR PACKAGES.
THAT'S WHY A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AGO WE PREVIEWED A CAPABILITY
THAT ALLOWS CODEWHISPERER TO
SECURELY LEARN FROM YOUR
INTERNAL CODE BASE TO PROVIDE
MUCH, MUCH MORE PERTINENT,
CUSTOMIZED AND USEFUL CODE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS. CODEWHISPERER IS
AN EXPERT ON YOUR CODE AND CAN
PROVIDE MUCH MORE TAILORED
SUGGESTIONS. CREATING AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR INTERNAL
SDKS, YOUR APIS, YOUR LANGUAGES
AND YOUR CLASSES. AND OF COURSE
ANY CUSTOMIZATIONS ARE ISOLATE
AND WE NEVER USE CUSTOMERS
CONTENT FROM CODEWHISPERER TO
TRAIN ANY OF OUR UNDERLYING
MODELS. NOW TO UNDERSTAND THE
IMPACT OF THIS KIND OF
CUSTOMIZATION, WE WORKED WITH
PERSISTENT A DIGITAL ENGINEERING
PROVIDER. NOW
THEIR STUDIES SHOWED THAT
DEVELOPERS USING CODEWHISPERER
COMPLETED THEIR TASKS AN
ADDITIONAL 28% FASTER WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS THAN WITHOUT 28.
AND AWS IS THE ONLY MAJOR CLOUD
PROVIDER THAT'S CURRENTLY
AUTHORIZING OFFERING A
CUSTOMIZED CAPABILITY THAT
ANYONE CAN SIGN UP FOR AND USE
TODAY. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT CODEWHISPERER ABOUT
CODEWHISPERER CUSTOMIZATIONS AND
HOW IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU
ACCELERATE YOUR WORK AND
INCREASE YOUR IMPACT. BUT WE'RE
JUST GETTING STARTED AND WE SEE
A LOT MORE POTENTIAL USES WITH
GENERATIVE AI. FOR EXAMPLE,
THINK ABOUT GENERATIVE AI CHAT
APPLICATIONS. SO THESE DAYS IT
SEEMS LIKE JUST ABOUT EVERYONE
IS EXPERIMENTING WITH THEM,
RIGHT? AND WHAT THE EARLY
PROVIDERS IN THIS SPACE HAVE
DONE IS REALLY EXCITING AND IT'S
GENUINELY SUPER USEFUL FOR
CONSUMER OWNERS. BUT IN A LOT OF
WAYS, THESE APPLICATIONS DON'T
REALLY WORK AT WORK. THEY'RE
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR
CAPABILITIES ARE GREAT, BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR COMPANY. THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR DATA, YOUR
CUSTOMERS OR YOUR OPERATIONS.
AND THIS LIMITS HOW HOW USEFUL
THEIR SUGGESTIONS CAN BE. THEY
ALSO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHO
YOU ARE AT WORK. THEY DON'T KNOW
YOUR ROLE, YOUR PREFERENCES,
WHAT INFORMATION YOU USE AND
WHAT YOU DO, AND DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO. SO CRITICALLY. OTHER
PROVIDERS WHO HAVE LAUNCHED
TOOLS, THEY'VE LAUNCHED THEM
WITHOUT DATA PRIVACY AND
SECURITY CAPABILITIES. THE
VIRTUE ALI EVERY ENTERPRISE
REQUIRES. AND SO MANY CIOS
ACTUALLY BANNED THE USE OF A LOT
OF THESE MOST POPULAR CHAT
ASSISTANTS INSIDE THEIR
ORGANIZATIONS. AND THIS HAS BEEN
WELL PUBLICIZED AND JUST ASK ANY
CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY
OFFICER OR CSO AND THEY'LL TELL
YOU YOU CAN'T REALLY BOLT ON
SECURITY AFTER THE FACT. AND
EXPECT IT TO WORK AS WELL. IT'S
MUCH, MUCH BETTER TO BUILD
SECURITY INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL
DESIGN OF THE TECHNOLOGY. SO
WHEN WE SET OUT TO BUILD
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS, WE
KNEW WE HAD TO ADDRESS THESE
GAPS, HAD TO BE BUILT IN FROM
THE VERY START. RIGHT? AND
THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M REALLY
PROUD AND EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
AMAZON MQ A NEW TYPE OF
GENERATIVE AI POWERED ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO WORK FOR YOU AT WORK
. Q LETS YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS
QUICKLY WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE
INTERACTIONS, YOU CAN EASILY
CHAT, GENERATE CONTENT, TAKE
ACTIONS, AND IT'S ALL INFORMED
BY AN UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA REPOSITOR WIZ
YOUR OPERATIONS. AND OF COURSE
WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT ROCK SOLID
SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARE. SO Q
UNDERSTANDS AND RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING IDENTITIES, YOUR ROLES
AND YOUR PERMISSIONS. IF A USER
DOES NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO
ACCESS SOMETHING WITHOUT Q, THEY
CANNOT ACCESS IT WITH Q EITHER.
AND WE'VE DESIGNED Q TO MEET
ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS AND
ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS STRINGENT
REQUIREMENTS FROM DAY ONE. AND
WE NEVER WANT BUSINESS CUSTOMERS
CONTENT. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
USE THAT CONTENT FOR. Q TO TRAIN
UNDERLYING MODELS. I REALLY
BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO BE
TRANSFORMATIVE. WE WANT LOTS OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO DO
LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
TO BENEFIT FROM AMAZON. Q NOW,
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. WE WANT Q
TO HELP DEVELOPERS AND BUILDERS
BE MORE EFFICIENT, MORE
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND MORE
PROFICIENT. SO FOR STARTERS,
AMAZON Q IS YOUR EXPERT
ASSISTANT FOR BUILDING ON AWS
NOW TO SUPERCHARGE WORK FOR
DEVELOPERS AND IT PROS? WE'VE
TRAINED AMAZON Q ON 17 YEARS
WORTH OF KNOWLEDGE SO IT CAN
TRANSFORM THE WAY YOU THINK,
OPTIMIZE AND OPERATE
APPLICATIONS AND WORKLOADS ON
AWS AND WE'VE PUT AMAZON. Q
WHERE YOU WORK, SO IT'S READY TO
ASSIST YOU IN THE AWS MANAGEMENT
CONSOLE AND DOCUMENTATION CHAN
IN YOUR IDP VIA CODEWHISPERER
AND IN YOUR TEAM CHAT ROOMS LIKE
SLACK, YOU CAN CHAT WITH AWS
CLOUD TO EXPLORE AWS
CAPABILITIES, LEARN UNFAMILIAR
TECHNOLOGIES, ARCHITECT
SOLUTIONS. ITS AN EXPERT IN AWS
WELL-ARCHITECTED PATTERNS LEARNS
BEST PRACTICES AND SOLUTION
IMPLEMENTATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK AMAZON Q HOW DO I
BUILD A WEB APPLICATION WITH
AWS? WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? IT'S
GOING TO ANSWER WITH A LIST OF
POTENTIAL SERVICES THAT YOU
COULD USE, SUCH AS AMPLIFY,
LAMBDA OR EC2, AND THEN IT'S
GOING TO OFFER REASONS WHY YOU
MIGHT CONSIDER EACH SERVICE.
FROM THERE YOU CAN FURTHER
NARROW DOWN YOUR OPTIONS THROUGH
NATURAL LANGUAGE, LIKE WHICH OF
THESE WOULD BE PREFERRED? IF MY
APP IS ONLY NEEDS TO RUN FOR A
FEW SECONDS AND ONLY HAS VERY
INFREQUENT TRAFFIC LAMBDA AMAZON
Q IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR
REQUIREMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION
AND IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE YOU
WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ONCE YOU'VE
CHOSEN A SERVICE, YOU CAN ASK
AMAZON. Q HOW DO I GET STARTED?
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU STEP
BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR
CONFIGURING THE SOLUTION PLUS
LINKS TO RELEVANT INFORMATION TO
DOCUMENT STATION AND SO ON. AND
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF
HOW AMAZON Q IS GOING TO HELP
YOU WITH YOUR WORK. FOR EXAMPLE,
IF YOU ENCOUNTER AN ERROR WITH
LAMBDA IN THE CONSOLE, YOU JUST
PRESS THE TROUBLESHOOT ROUTE
WITH AMAZON Q BUTTON, AND Q IS
GOING TO RESEARCH THE ERROR, AND
IT'S GOING TO SUGGEST HOW TO FIX
IT. AMAZON. Q CAN ALSO
TROUBLESHOOT YOUR NETWORK
CONNECTIONS AND IT CAN ANALYZE
YOUR END TO END NETWORK
CONFIGURATION AND HELP RESOLVE
OF CONNECTIVITY ISSUES QUICKLY.
THAT IS A HUGE TIME SAVER. NOW
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU HELP US WITH?
HOW ABOUT CHOOSING THE OPTIMAL
EC2 INSTANCE SO YOU CAN JUST
TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR WORKLOAD AND
GET AN ACCURATE, QUICK AND
ECONOMICAL INSTANCE TYPE
RECOMMENDATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
WHICH EC2 INSTANCE TYPES PROVIDE
THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE FOR
VIDEO ENCODING AND TRANSCODING
WORKLOADS SUPPORTING GAMING USE
CASES AND YOU GET YOUR
RECOMMENDATION. IT'S THAT EASY.
THIS IS ALL VERY COOL AND WE
EXPECT THAT AMAZON Q IS GOING TO
SAVE CUSTOMERS SO MUCH TIME IN
ARCHITECTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
AND OPTIMIZING YOUR WORKLOADS.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL THE Q CAN DO
FOR YOU. AMAZON Q IS ALSO GOING
TO BE IN THE IDP FOR DEVELOPERS.
IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE
CODE IN THE IDE OR YOU NEED TO
DIG IN INTO HOW A SPECIFIC
FUNCTION WORKS, AMAZON, Q AND
CODEWHISPERER IS GOING TO HELP
YOU GET UP TO SPEED BY USING ITS
DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF AWS AND ITS
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR CODE BASES
. SO YOU NEED TO ADD TESTS. JUST
ASK Q AND IT'S GOING TO
AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE THE TEST
FOR YOU. AND THIS IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
DEVELOPERS. BUT WE KNEW WE COULD
DO EVEN MORE TO HELP YOU BUILD
EVEN FASTER. FOR EXAMPLE, THINK
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO
BUILDING A NEW FEATURE. YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENTS.
THINK THROUGH DESIGN, WRITE ALL
THE CODE, ADD TESTS, DOCUMENT
THE CODE AND SO ON, AND A FILE
COULD SPAN HUNDREDS TO EVEN
THOUSANDS OF LINES OF CODE. AND
THIS IS A DAUNTING TASK. IF
YOU'RE USING AMAZON
CODEWHISPERER IT'S GOING TO
GENERATE CHUNKS OF NEW CODE FOR
YOU, WHICH IS A REAL TIME SAVER
THAT STILL LEAVES ALL THE REST.
SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR
AMAZON. Q SPECIFICALLY, Q'S
FEATURE DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY,
WHICH IS GOING TO AUTOMATE THE
MULTI STEP DEVELOPMENT TASK OF
ADDING NEW FEATURES TO YOUR
APPLICATION. SO INSTEAD OF ALL
THAT WORK NOW YOU JUST WRITE A
PROMPT AND Q IS GOING TO USE ITS
EXPERTISE ENRICHED WITH AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR PROJECT
CODE, AND IT'S GOING TO DO ALL
THE HEAVY LIFTING FOR YOU. SO
AMAZON Q WILL CREATE THE DRAFT
PLAN, WHICH YOU CAN THEN
COLLABORATE AND ITERATIVELY
IMPROVE USING NATURAL LANGUAGE
CHAT UNTIL IT'S POLISHED AND
READY TO GO. AND THEN Q REALLY
KICKS INTO GEAR. IT'S GOING TO
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN ACROSS YOUR
FILES IN YOUR APPLICATION. AN
AND YOU REMAIN IN CONTROL USING
YOUR EXPERTISE TO REVIEW CHANGES
AND ENSURE THE VERY BEST
QUALITY. SO THIS IS HOURS OF
WORK THAT Q CAN DO FOR YOU WITH
JUST ONE GOOD PROMPT. AND THIS
FEATURE IS AVAILABLE TODAY IN
AMAZON CODE CATALYST AND WILL
SOON BE FULLY AVAILABLE IN THE
IDE. YOU WILL NOT CURRENTLY FIND
AN AI ASSISTANT FROM ANOTHER
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER THAT CAN DO
THIS FOR YOU TODAY. BUT WE'RE
NOT DONE YET. LET'S KEEP GOING.
WE KNOW THAT DEVELOPERS SPEND A
LOT OF TIME SLOGGING THROUGH THE
MUCK THAT COMES WITH MAINTENANCE
AND UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE AND
UPGRADES. BIG DEAL, RIGHT? SO
TAKE TAKE LANGUAGE VERSION
UPGRADES, FOR EXAMPLE. HOW MANY
OF YOU ARE USING OLDER VERSIONS
OF JAVA? BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO
TAKE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS TO
UPGRADE HANDS? OH YEAH. A LOT OF
THEM. SO MIGRATIONS ARE
INEVITABLY COME WITH A LOT OF
NUANCE AND EDGE CASES. AND SO
YOU END UP SPENDING A TON OF
TIME WRITING AND REWRITING THE
CODE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND
TRYING TO GET IT COMPILE TO
COMPILE AND WORK. AND SOMETIMES
THESE PROGRAMS TAKE SO LONG THAT
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE IN A
MIGRATION INFINITY LOOP. JUST AS
ONE ENDS, THE NEXT BEGINS. AND
IT'S NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE
TEMPTATION TO JUST MAINTAIN
STATUS QUO. BUT DOING THAT MEANS
THAT YOU MISS OUT ON PERFORMANCE
IMPROVEMENTS AND IT MEANS MUCH
WORSE THAT IT CAN ALSO OPEN YOU
UP TO POTENTIAL SECURITY
VULNERABILITIES. AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT INTO AMAZON. Q CODE
TRANSFORMATION, WHICH HELPS YOU
WITH UPGRADES TO TRANSFORM CODE
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME THAT
IT TAKES TODAY. ALL THE
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO ALL A
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO IS ASK YOU
TO PERFORM THE CODE
TRANSFORMATION AND IT HANDLES
THE REST FROM IDENTIFYING AND
UPGRADING AND MANDATORY CODE
PACKAGE DEPOSITORIES AND
FRAMEWORKS TO REPLACING
DEPRECATED CODE AND
INCORPORATING SECURITY BEST
PRACTICES. CUZ EVEN GOING TO RUN
TESTS ON THE UPGRADED
APPLICATION VERSION. SO WE'VE
BEEN USING THIS, THIS
APPLICATION, THIS THIS
CAPABILITY INTERNALLY AND THE
RESULTS ARE STUNNING. SO WITH
AMAZON Q TRANSFORMATION IN A
VERY SMALL TEAM OF AMAZON
DEVELOPERS SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADED
1000 APPLICATIONS FROM JAVA
EIGHT TO JAVA 17 IN JUST TWO
DAYS. NOW I'M GOING TO SAY THAT
AGAIN, 1000 APPLICATION UPGRADES
IN TWO DAYS. THAT'S HOW LONG A
SINGLE APPLICATION UPGRADE USED
TO TAKE. I MEAN, THIS IS MONTHS,
MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS OF
DEVELOPER TIME SAVED A LOT OF
VERY HAPPY PEOPLE AT AMAZON OVER
THIS. I PROMISE YOU. SO TODAY,
AMAZON. Q CAN WORK ITS MAGIC ON
JAVA UPGRADES, BUT SOON YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT TO
HELP MIGRATE YOUR NETWORK LOADS
FROM WINDOWS TO LINUX. AND THERE
ARE A LOT OF APPLICATIONS OUT
THERE STUCK ON WINDOWS BECAUSE
OF THE SHEER EFFORT REQUIRED IN
MAKING THE MIGRATION. AND THIS
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HUGE COST
SAVINGS ON COSTLY LICENSING FEES
ON TOP OF THE INHERENT
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY
BENEFITS. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE
OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION? ALL THE FOLKS IN
MARKETING, FINANCE, HR, PRODUCT
MANAGEMENT AND MORE? THERE'S SO
MUCH INFORMATION SPREAD ACROSS
YOUR ORGANIZATION'S DOCUMENTS,
VASS ALL OF YOUR DATA, ALL OF
YOUR APPLICATIONS, ASIANS AND
PEOPLE IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
ROLES, THEY STRUGGLE EVERY DAY
TO FIND THE INFORMATION THAT
THEY NEED TO AND THEN TRANSFORM
IT INTO MAKING DECISIONS AND
TAKING ACTIONS AND DOING THAT
FAST ENOUGH TO STAY COMPETITIVE,
OF FINDING RELEVANT INFORMATION,
MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS, TAKING
ACTION THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR,
RIGHT? YEP AMAZON. Q IS ALSO
YOUR BUSINESS EXPERT. Q HAS
CONNECTIONS TO OVER 40 POPULAR
ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS, SO EMPLOYEES
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION CAN ASK
COMPLEX QUESTIONS AND GET
DETAILED, ACCURATE, NUANCED
ANSWERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO
THEIR ROLE AT WORK. AND AGAIN,
SECURE IS SECURE AND Q IS SECURE
AND PRIVATE. IT RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING ROLES AND THE
PERMISSIONS THAT ARE GRANTED
UNIQUELY TO EACH USER. WE'RE
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, AND I
ACTUALLY WANTED TO SHOW YOU JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF AMAZON. Q AND
FOR YOUR BUSINESS IN ACTION. SO
TO PUT THROUGH Q PUT Q THROUGH
ITS PACES. PLEASE WELCOME AWS
OWN DR. MATT WOOD TO THE STAGE.
THANKS, ADAM, AND GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE. I'M EXCITED TO GIVE
YOU A FIRST LOOK AT AMAZON. Q A
NEW TYPE OF AI ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO BE AN EXPERT IN YOUR
BUSINESS WITH AMAZON. Q YOU CAN
GET QUICK, ACCURATE, RELEVANT
ANSWERS TO YOUR MOST PRESSING
BUSINESS QUESTIONS, ALL
DELIVERED SECURELY AND
PRIVATELY. GETTING STARTED WITH
Q IS SIMPLE AND TAKES JUST THREE
STEPS. FIRST, YOU CONFIGURE
AMAZON Q BY CONNECTING AND
CUSTOMIZING Q WITH DETAILS OF
YOUR OWN ORGANIZATION. THEN Q
CONNECTS TO EXISTING DATA
SOURCES LIKE S3 SALESFORCE,
MICROSOFT, GOOGLE SLACK AND MORE
SUPPORTING OVER 40 POPULAR
BUSINESS APPLICATIONS AND
SERVICES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.
ONCE CONNECTED AMAZON Q STARTS
INDEXING ALL OF YOUR DATA AND
CONTENT, LEARNING EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR
BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES
UNDERSTANDING THE CORE CONCEPT
PRODUCT NAMES, ORGANIZATION,
STRUCTURE, ALL THE DETAILS THAT
MAKE YOUR BUSINESS UNIQUE, AS
WELL AS INDEXING THE DATA FROM
THESE SOURCES. Q ALSO USES
GENERATIVE AI TO UNDERSTAND AND
CAPTURE THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION
WHICH MAKES YOUR BUSINESS
UNIQUE. THIS ADDITIONAL SEMANTIC
INFORMATION IS CAPTURED AS
VECTOR EMBEDDINGS, ALLOWING Q TO
PROVIDE HIGHLY RELEVANT RESULTS
WHICH ARE TAILORED TO YOUR
SPECIFIC COMPANY AND INDUSTRY.
YOUR DATA REMAINS COMPLETELY
UNDER YOUR CONTROL AT ALL TIMES.
AMAZON Q NEVER SHARES IT
EXTERNALLY OR USES IT TO IMPROVE
ANY OF THE UNDERLYING MODELS,
AND THAT'S IT. SURPRISE. THERE
IS NO STEP THREE. JUST OPEN
AMAZON Q IN YOUR BROWSER AND
AWAY YOU GO WITH A FULLY
CUSTOMIZED, SECURE ASSISTANT WHO
IS AN EXPERT IN YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU COMMUNICATE WITH Q THROUGH
THIS FRIENDLY WEB APPLICATION
DESIGNED FOR EVERYONE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION TO USE. Q KNOWS WHO
YOU ARE AND ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY
AND ROLE. AND BECAUSE Q
UNDERSTANDS YOUR BUSINESS
SEMANTICS, YOU CAN ASK FAR MORE
DETAILED AND NUANCED QUESTIONS
AND GET TAILORED ANSWERS FASTER
THAN EVER BEFORE FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK Q TO ANALYZE WHICH
PRODUCT FEATURES CUSTOMERS ARE
STRUGGLING WITH AND RECOMMEND
WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM AS SOON AS
YOU HIT ENTER. Q GETS TO WORK ON
UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION AND
PREPARING AN ANSWER. Q STARTS BY
CREATING A SET OF INPUT PROMPTS.
AUTOMATIC ALI. Q THEN USES ALL
OF THE BUSINESS CONTEXT
AVAILABLE TO FIND RELEVANT DATA,
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS AND
PICKS THE BEST ONES BEFORE
COMBINING EVERYTHING TOGETHER
INTO A RESPONSE, ALL IN JUST A
FRACTION OF A SECOND, USING THE
POWER OF GENERATIVE AI AMAZON Q
REMAINS FAITHFUL TO YOUR
ORIGINAL SOURCES, CITING THEM IN
LINE SO THAT YOU CAN VALIDATE
THE INFORMATION EASILY. Q'S
EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE MAGICAL, BUT
THERE IS NO MAGICAL BLACK BOX
JUST GIVING YOU ANSWERS. YOU CAN
UPLOAD NEW WORD DOCUMENTS TO
CSVS AND OTHER FILES ON THE FLY.
GO TO Q TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS
RESPONSES, LETTING YOU ASK
QUESTIONS ABOUT AD HOC DATA
WHICH HASN'T YET BEEN ADDED TO
ANY CORPORATE SYSTEM. AND AMAZON
Q WAS BUILT WITH PRIVACY AND
SECURITY IN MIND FROM THE GROUND
UP. SO EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SEEK
INFORMATION TO WHICH WE DON'T
HAVE ACCESS, AMAZON Q RESPECTS
YOUR EXISTING ACCESS CONTROLS
ONLY RETURNING INFORMATION
YOU'RE AUTHORIZED TO SEE. ADMINS
CAN ALSO RESTRICT SENSITIVE
TOPICS FILTERING OUT
INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS AND
ANSWERS WHERE NECESSARY. FINALLY
AMAZON Q CAN TAKE ACTIONS ON
YOUR BEHALF THROUGH A SET OF
CONFIGURABLE PLUGINS? AS AN
EXAMPLE, IF YOU UPDATE, SAY,
YOUR TRAINING PRIORITIES, Q CAN
AUTOMATICALLY CREATE TICKETS IN
JIRA. NOTIFY LEADERS IN SLACK
AND UPDATE DASHBOARDS IN
SERVICENOW. Q ALLOWS YOU TO
INSPECT ACTIONS BEFORE THEY RUN
SO YOU CAN REVIEW THEM AND ADD
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND
AFTER THE ACTION RUNS, Q WILL
LINK TO THE RESULTS FOR
VERIFICATION. SO IN SUMMARY,
AMAZON Q BRINGS AI ASSISTANT
INTO THE BUSINESS WORLD,
PROVIDING SECURE TO RELEVANT AND
ACTIONABLE GUIDANCE TAILORED
ENTIRELY TO YOUR COMPANY. WE
CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO TRY. Q AND
SEE HOW IT WILL HELP YOUR
ORGANIZATION WITH THAT. BACK TO
ADAM. THANKS A LOT. THAT WAS
AWESOME. AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
BUSINESSES. EMPLOYEES ARE GOING
TO LOVE AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS AND DISCOVER
AND SYNTHESIZE NEW INFORMATION
AND LIFT FOLKS OUT OF MONOTONOUS
DRAG OF REPETITIVE TASKS. AND IT
IS GOING TO LOVE HOW ALL OF THIS
COMES WITH RIGOROUS SECURITY AND
PRIVACY. NOW, I KNOW AT LEAST A
FEW OF YOU OUT THERE ARE
WONDERING IF AMAZON Q CAN ACCESS
MY DATA? DOES THAT MEAN IT CAN
HELP WITH MY BUSINESS
INTELLIGENCE? YES. AND OF COURSE
THE ANDREW NG ANSWER IS A
RESOUNDING YES. SO WE'VE BEEN
WORKING FOR A WHILE TO MAKE
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE MORE
ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WITHOUT BI
EXPERTISE. WE THINK ANYONE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS
OF THEIR DATA USING NATURAL
LANGUAGE AND SO AMAZON
QUICKSIGHT OUR ML POWER BI
SERVICE NOW HAS AMAZON Q
FEATURES BUILT IN FIRST AMAZON Q
IS GOING TO HELP REDUCE THE TIME
THAT IT TAKES BUSINESS ANALYSTS
TO CREATE DASHBOARDS AND REPORTS
FROM HOURS DOWN TO MINUTES BY
LETTING THEM SIMPLY TELL AMAZON
Q WHAT THEY WANT TO VISUALIZE.
FOR EXAMPLE, REGIONAL SALES BY
PRODUCT IS A SANKEY DIAGRAM. Q
COMES RIGHT BACK WITH THAT
DIAGRAM. UM, AND YOU CAN ADD IT
TO YOUR DASHBOARD WITH EASE AND
YOU CAN TELL. Q TO FURTHER
REFINE THE VISUAL, SAY YOU WANT
TO CHANGE THE CHART TO A
VERTICAL STACKED BAR CHART BY
MONTH AND COLOR CODED BY REGION.
YOUR WISH IS Q'S COMMAND. WITH
Q, YOU CAN GET BETTER DASHBOARDS
FASTER, BUT EVEN THE BEST
DASHBOARDS DON'T TELL EVERY
ANGLE OF THE STORY. FOR, FOR
EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ASK AMAZON. Q
WHERE DID WE HAVE THE HIGHEST
SALES? AND YOU GET A GET A
RESPONSE CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR
BUSINESS DATA. YOU CAN ASK A
FOLLOW UP QUESTION EVEN AS
LITTLE AS ONE WORD LIKE LONDON.
AND BECAUSE Q MAINTAINS THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR CURRENT
CONVERSATIONS, YOU CAN GET
INSIGHTS FROM YOUR DATA QUICKLY.
ORI NOW ENABLING PEOPLE TO TALK
TO Q AND QUICKSIGHT IS A BIG
STEP FORWARD IN HELPING YOUR
ORGANIZATION BE EVEN MORE DATA
DRIVEN. BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
GETTING HANDS ON WITH DATA. A
LOT OF PEOPLE CONSUME DATA
THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AND
REPORTS, AND SO, SO MUCH OF YOU
DO AT WORK IS TELLING STORIES
WITH DATA. AND AS YOUR BUSINESS
EXPERT, Q IS HERE TO MAKE THAT
EASIER TOO. LET'S SAY YOU WANT
TO CREATE A MONTHLY REPORT ON
YOUR BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA.
YOU CAN ASK YOU TO WRITE A
MONTHLY REPORT ABOUT THE
BUSINESS AND MAKE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT MONTH.
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU
VISUALIZATION OPTIONS. YOU
CHOOSE THE ONES YOU WANT, AND
THEN Q WILL FORMAT THEM. AND IN
SECONDS YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL AND
COMPELLING STORY AND IT'S
COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE. YOU CAN
ACTUALLY ADD MORE CONTEXT TO THE
SECTION BY ASKING YOU TO ADD A
VISUAL OF THE USAGE TREND, AND Q
WILL GENERATE A SHORT SUMMARY.
AND THEN YOU CAN FURTHER TWEAK
IT BY MAKING IT LONGER, SHORTER
OR REFORMATTING IT TO BULLETS.
LET'S MAKE IT LONGER. ONCE WE'RE
HAPPY WITH THE STORY, WE CAN
SECURELY SHARE IT WITH OTHERS.
WITH AMAZON Q AND QUICKSIGHT YOU
NOW HAVE AN EXPERT BI ASSISTANT
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR BUSINESS ANALYSTS AND IT'S
GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR END
USERS TO GET ANSWERS TO AND
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND THESE NEW Q
CAPABILITIES AND QUICKSIGHT ARE
AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW TODAY. NOW,
A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE
TARGETED TO HORIZONTAL USE CASES
OR SPECIFIC LINES OF BUSINESS
AND AWS HAS APPLICATIONS IN
THESE AREAS TOO. SO OUR FIRST
SPECIALIZED LINE OF BUSINESS
SOLUTION WAS AMAZON CONNECT. SO
IT'S BORN IN THE CLOUD AND OF
COURSE, AMAZON CONNECT IS A
SCALABLE COST EFFECTIVE, EASY TO
USE. CONTACT CENTER APPLICATION
THAT'S REINVENTED CUSTOMER
SERVICE GENERATIVE AI THAT KNOWS
YOUR BUSINESS IS GOING TO HAVE
AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON THE
WHOLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
EXPERIENCE ACROSS SO MANY
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. YOUR
CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAMS ARE AT
THE HEART OF YOUR BUSINESSES
DELIVERING INTERACTIONS THAT
PEOPLE REMEMBER FOR GOOD AND FOR
BAD. SO GETTING THIS RIGHT
REALLY MATTERS IS TODAY CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS SPEND A LOT OF
TIME GATHERING INFORMATION FROM
CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR
QUESTIONS AND THEN THEY SPEND
EVEN MORE TIME SEARCHING FOR THE
RIGHT ANSWER. NOW CONNECT HAS
MADE THIS A LOT EASIER ALREADY
WITH MACHINE LEARNING
TRANSCRIPTION ANALYTICS, BUT WE
KNEW WE COULD MAKE IT EVEN
BETTER FOR YOUR AGENTS AND
CERTAINLY FOR THE CUSTOMERS
WAITING ON THE OTHER END OF THE
LINE FOR HELP. ENTER AMAZON Q
AND CONNECT AVAILABLE TODAY AND
THIS IS GOING TO GIVE CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS A MAJOR ASSIST
AGENTS CAN CHAT WITH. Q DIRECTLY
INSIDE OF AMAZON CONNECT TO HELP
THEM RESPOND QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS. LIVE CHAT WITH Q WITH
FAST ANSWERS IS GREAT, BUT WHAT
IF YOU COULD MAKE THE CALL
ITSELF THE PROMPT NOW INSIDE OF
CONNECT? Q IS ACTUALLY THERE ON
THE CALLS ASSISTING WITH
PROPOSED RESPONSES WITH
SUGGESTED ACTIONS, WITH LINKS TO
RELEVANT ARTICLES? NO TYPING
REQUIRED, SO CONTACT CENTERS,
SUPERVISORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
ARE ALSO GOING TO GET A
GENERATIVE AI BOOST CONNECT NOW
AUTOMATICALLY CREATES POST CALL
SUMMARIES THAT SUPERVISORS CAN
USE TO TRACK FOLLOW UP ACTIONS
AND TO UNCOVER AGENT COACHING
OPPORTUNITIES. AND FOR
ADMINISTRATORS, CONNECT CAN SET
UP CHAT BOTS AND INTERACTIVE
VOICE RESPONSES THROUGH SIMPLE
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPTS.
STREAMLINE LEARNING THE PROCESS.
AMAZON Q IS JUST THE FIRST OF
MANY SPECIALIZED INDUSTRY AND
USE CASE SPECIFIC SERVICES THAT
ARE GOING TO SUPERCHARGE AMAZON
Q SO STAY TUNED. AMAZON
CODEBUILD AMAZON Q BUILDER, YOUR
AWS EXPERT, AWS Q BUSINESS, YOUR
BUSINESS EXPERT AT AMAZON, Q AND
QUICKSIGHT YOUR BUSINESS

APPLICATIONS AND CAPABILITIES
THAT CAN BE ENRICHED WITH THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR BUSINESS. AND
IT'S ALL ON AWS BUILT WITH OUR
HIGH BAR THAT GIVES YOU BROAD
AND DEEP CAPABILITIES, CHOICE
AND ENTERPRISE READINESS. BUT
IT'S SO EARLY IN THE GAME AND
WE'RE INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
DO TOGETHER. NOW, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING THAT CUSTOMERS ARE
GOING TO NEED FOR ANY OF THIS TO
WORK, AND THAT'S DATA. YOUR
DATA. NO ONE ELSE HAS IT. NO ONE
ELSE CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU CAN
. YOUR DATA IS KEY TO SETTING
YOUR ORGANIZATION APART FROM THE
PACK. AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED,
GENERATIVE AI HAS JUST MADE IT
SO MUCH MORE RELEVANT AND
IMPACTFUL WHEN YOU TAILOR YOUR
DATA. SO LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM A
LONG TIME CUSTOMER ABOUT HOW
THEY'RE USING DATA TO CREATE
FIRST CLASS EXPERIENCES FOR
THEIR CUSTOMERS. SO PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE, STEPHANE
DURACH, VP OF CONNECTED COMPANY
AT BMW.
THANK YOU. HELLO EVERYONE. IT'S
FANTASTIC TO BE HERE. I COULDN'T
AGREE MORE DATA IS KEY. THE
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCT COMPLEXITY IS
STRONGLY INCREASED. KING AND
DEVELOPMENT SPEED IS ESSENTIAL.
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW BMW IS
MASTERING DATA ACCELERATING THE
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND
DELIVERING BEST IN CLASS
EXPERIENCE TO OUR CUSTOMER
ANYWHERE. AND ANYTIME ACROSS THE
ENTIRE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO FROM
BMW TO MINI AND EVEN ROLLS-ROYCE
, BMW IS PROVIDING GAME CHANGING
VEHICLE ENTERTAINMENT AND
EXPERIENCE POWERED BY AWS. WE
OPTIMIZE OUR TECH STACK, IMPROVE
OUR WORKFLOW AND USE DATA BY
LEVERAGING AWS CLOUD TECHNOLOGY.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES.
CLOUD DATA, BMW CENTRAL DATA
LAKE BUILT BY BMW AND AWS HOSTED
DATA FROM OUR CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET AND BY UPLOADING UPHOLDING
THE STRICTEST DATA PRIVACY
STANDARDS ON TOP OF IT, TEAMS
CAN BUILD THEIR APPLICATION AND
MODEL AS WELL AS DEPLOY UPDATES
AND IMPROVEMENTS TOGETHER. WE
ARE EXPLORING INNOVATIVE USE OF
MACHINE LEARNING, INCLUDING
AMAZON SAGEMAKER. THIS AUTOMATED
DRIVING PLATFORM IS BY BMW IS
BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF
DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEM ON
AWS. THIS AUTOMATED DRIVING
PLATFORM IS CAPABLE TO HANDLE
SEVERAL HUNDRED PETABYTE OF DATA
FROM OUR GLOBAL TEST FLEET. WE
ARE ACCELERATE TESTING OUR
DEVELOPMENT, SIMULATING AND
VALIDATION PROCESS DRAMATICALLY
FOR OUR PRODUCT LAUNCH IN 2025
WITH OUR ROUTE OPTIMIZED
CHARGING SERVICES, WE ARE
PROVIDING REAL TIME TRAFFIC
CALCULATION BASED ON DRIVING
STYLE PREFERENCE TRAFFIC OR
AVAILABLE CHARGING STATIONS AND
MANY MORE. WE ALSO USE AMAZON
TECHNOLOGY LIKE ALEXA FOR OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
AND FIRE TV TO CREATE UNIQUE
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, INSIGHT,
THE VEHICLE, OUR CONNECTED
VEHICLE AI PLATFORM IS BUILT ON
AWS AND FORMED THE BACKBONE OF
THE LARGEST CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET WHERE DE FOR SOME MORE
EVEN EYE OPENING STATS, LET'S
DIVE IN. 20 YEARS AGO BMW
INTRODUCED ITS FIRST VEHICLE
CONNECTED VEHICLE AND WE COME
QUITE A LONG WAY SINCE THEN. AND
NOW THE BMW GROUP HAS THE
LARGEST CONNECTED FLEET WITH
MORE THAN 20 MILLION VEHICLES
GLOBALLY OVER THE LAST THREE
YEARS. WE MIGRATED THE CONNECTED
VEHICLE BACKEND TO AWS BY
UTILIZING THE GLOBAL PRESENCE OF
AWS IN MANY REGIONS WORLDWIDE.
WE ARE UPDATE ADDING MORE THAN 6
MILLION VEHICLES OVER THE AIR ON
A REGULAR BASIS. THE THOSE
NUMBERS ARE GROWING CONSTANTLY.
IT REQUIRES TO MANAGE MORE THAN
12 BILLION REQUESTS PER DAY WITH
OVER 1000 DIFFERENT
MICROSERVICES. ULTIMATELY, WE
ARE PROCESSING MORE THAN 110TB
OF DATA TRAFFIC PER DAY WITH A
REMARKABLE RELIABILITY. LOOK AT
THESE NUMBERS. I'M ALWAYS
IMPRESSED, HOWEVER, WITH OUR NEW
PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE. THIS
NUMBER WILL TRIPLE IN THE NEXT
TWO YEARS. LET'S CHANGE
PERSPECTIVE AND TAKE A LOOK AT A
COUPLE OF NUMBERS IN THE
DEVELOPMENT PHASE. MORE THAN
8500 SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
WORLDWIDE CREATE FIRST CLASS
CODE FOR OUR VEHICLE AND
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE BMW SERIES
RUN SEVEN SERIES RUNS ON OVER
500 MILLION LINES OF CODE. OUR
WORLDWIDE DEV OPS TEAMS EXECUTE
MORE THAN 110 SOFTWARE, BUILDS
EVERY DAY BY USING MORE THAN
60,000 VIRTUAL CPUS TO KEEP UP
WITH OUR DEMAND. WE USE AWS
SERVICES TO SCALE UP AND
ACCELERATE DEVELOPMENT WHENEVER
IT IS NECESSARY. LET'S TAKE A
DEEPER LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT.
TRADITIONALLY, BMW'S COMES FROM
A HARDWARE DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
AND EVERY DEVELOPER HAD TO DO
THE DEVELOPMENT WORK ON A
PHYSICAL TEST TRACK. TODAY WE
ARE USING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY
TO STREAMLINE OUR INFOTAINMENT
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE NEW
APPROACH ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE
TEST FUNCTIONALITIES REMOTELY TO
OUR GLOBAL DEVELOPER TEAMS. AN
EXAMPLE IS USING AMAZON EC2 FOR
VIRTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE
CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COLLABORATION.
OUR NEXT STEP IS TO EXTEND THIS
APPROACH TO BUILD A FULLY
VIRTUAL DIGITAL TWIN. NOW LET'S
TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND SOME
EXCITING FEATURES WE CREATED FOR
OUR MINI CUSTOMERS. ON THE
PICTURE, YOU CAN SEE THE MINI
INTERIOR. IT'S OUR WAY TO
EMPHASIZE BRAND TYPICAL DESIGN.
TAKE THE IMPRESSIVE ROUND ALI
DISPLAY IN OUR NEW MINI FAMILY.
AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, OUR SPEECH
IS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE DOMINANT
MODALITY FOR INTERACTING WITH
VEHICLES. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY
INTEGRATING ALEXA VOICE
ASSISTANT. HOWEVER, THIS YEAR WE
ARE RAISING THE BAR. WE WILL USE
ALEXA TECHNOLOGY TO BRING OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL. NOW LET'S
TAKE A SEAT IN THE BACK OF OUR
SEVEN SERIES. ONE OF OUR MOST
EXCITING FEATURE IS THE BMW
THEATER SCREEN. IT'S THE 30 INCH
SCREEN WITH AN EIGHT K
RESOLUTION. IT IS SPECTACULAR,
INTEGRATED IN THE CAR. IT GIVES
YOU A REAL CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE
WITH FIRE TV. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN
SEAMLESSLY ENJOY THEIR FAVORITE
SERIES AND MOVIES. IT'S OUR
STRONG COLLABORATION WITH AWS
AND AMAZON THAT UNLOCKS NEW
POSSIBILITIES, ENABLE US TO
THINK ABOUT THE CAR IN A NEW
DIMENSION. SO ONE LAST THING TO
GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE INTO THE
FUTURE. THIS IS THE BMW NEW
CLASS. THIS WILL LAUNCH IN 2025.
BMW HAS BEEN ALWAYS ON THE
FOREFRONT OF AUTOMOTIVE
INNOVATION. THE NEW CLASS WILL
BE A QUANTUM LEAP IN CUSTOMER
EXPERIENCE. IT WILL TAKE THE
DRIVING EXPERIENCE TO A NEW
LEVEL AS YOU CAN SEE, THE NEW
CLASS INTRODUCED A COMPLETELY
NEW INTERIOR WITH THE BMW
PANORAMIC VISION. WE DEVELOPED A
NEW HEAD UP DISPLAY TO PROJECT
INFORMATION PILLAR TO PILLAR,
AND FOR THE PERFECT DRIVER
ORIENTATION AND USER EXPERIENCE.
ALL OF THIS EMPHASIZES IMPROVE.
BMW IS MASTERING DATA
ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT
PROCESS AND DELIVERING THE BEST
IN CLASS EXPERIENCE TO THE
CUSTOMER ANYWHERE AND ANYTIME
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EXCITING AND
ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT
NOW. AWS AND THE BMW GROUP ARE
WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER TO
SHAPE THIS FUTURE. THANK YOU
ALL. GOODBYE AND I'LL SEE YOU
SOON. FOR AN INCREDIBLE DATA
PLATFORM YOU'VE BUILT AND THE
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE IT'S
CREATING FOR YOUR CONSUMERS.
JUST AMAZING. THANK YOU, STEFAN.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU, AS
ALWAYS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO
AS STEFAN HAS JUST MADE SO
CLEAR, SUCCESS WITH AI AS WELL
AS WITH NEARLY EVERY OTHER
BUSINESS PRIORITY RELIES ON
HAVING A STRONG DATA STRATEGY.
AND ONE QUESTION I HEAR FROM
CUSTOMERS FREQUENTLY IS HOW
SHOULD I THINK ABOUT DATA IN A
GENERATIVE AI WORLD? WELL, THE
ANSWER IS THAT FOR GENERATIVE
AI, YOUR DATA IS YOUR
DIFFERENTIATOR. NOW WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT CUSTOMIZATION THROUGH
BEDROCK CODEWHISPERER
CUSTOMIZATIONS, AMAZON TAILORED
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND EXAMPLES
FROM DELTA AIRLINES AND PFIZER
ALL TAL ADDING CONTEXT TO YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA IS ABSOLUTELY
CRITICAL TO PROVIDING VALUE.
NOW, IN EACH OF THESE EXAMPLES,
ALS, THE DATA USED TO CUSTOMIZE
THE APPLICATION HAS TO BE UP TO
DATE. IT HAD TO BE COMPLETE AND
ACCURATE. IT HAD TO BE
DISCOVERABLE AND IT HAD TO BE
AVAILABLE WHEN YOU NEEDED IT. SO
THE FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING ALL
OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE YOUR
DATA IS IN THE CLOUD. NOW,
GENERATIVE AI IS JUST ONE OF
MANY REASONS THAT YOU WANT THIS.
HAVING EFFECTIVE CLOUD BASED
DATA STRATEGY IS GOING TO
INCREASE YOUR INSIGHT. IT'S
GOING TO REDUCE YOUR COST AND
IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE
INNOVATION. NOW, TO UNDERSTAND
THIS, JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MANY
DIFFERENT ISSUES THERE ARE TO
CONSIDER WHEN TRYING TO MAKE THE
MOST OF YOUR DATA. ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA. IT
COMES FROM DIFFERENT ORIGINS,
AND IT COMES AT VARIOUS SCALES
AND SPEEDS AS DIFFERENT TEAMS
ALL ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION ARE
GOING TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT
DATA IN MANY, MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF WAYS. AND THEN HOW YOU
WANT TO USE THIS DATA IS JUST AS
VARIED. YOUR STORING IT, YOUR
POWERING, YOUR APPLICATIONS,
YOUR ANALYZING IT, YOU'RE
GENERATING PREDICTIONS FROM IT.
THERE'S NO ONE TOOL OR SOLUTION
THAT CAN DO IT ALL UNLESS YOU'RE
WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES LIKE
PERFORMANCE COST OR
CAPABILITIES. BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE THOSE SACRIFICE CHOICES.
SO WHAT YOU NEED IS A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF TOOLS THAT
ACCOUNTS FOR THE SCALE AND THE
VARIETY OF THIS DATA AND THE
MANY, MANY PURPOSES FOR WHICH
YOU WANT TO USE IT. YOU NEED TO
INTEGRATE IT AND COMBINE ALL
THAT DATA THAT'S SPREAD ALL OVER
TO CREATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND PREDICT
WHAT WILL HAPPEN. AND OF COURSE,
YOU NEED GOVERNANCE SO THAT YOU
CAN HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE OF
ACCESS AND CONTROL EVERY STEP OF
THE WAY. YOU NEED IT ALL. IF YOU
MISS EVEN ONE ASPECT, YOUR
ABILITY TO USE THAT DATA IS
SIGNIFICANTLY HOBBLED. SO IN
ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN
STORE, ANALYZE AND PROCESS THE
DATA YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF DATA
SERVICES SO YOU CAN GET THE
PRICE PERFORMANCE, YOU CAN GET
THE SPEED, THE FLEXIBILITY AND
THE CAPABILITIES FOR YOUR USE
CASE. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
BUILT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SET
OF CLOUD DATA SERVICES OUT THERE
. SO TO START, WE HAVE AMAZON S3
AND CUSTOMERS USE S3 TO MAKE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DATA
LAKES WHERE THEY CAN BRING
STRUCTURED DATA TOGETHER WITH
UNSTRUCTURED DATA AND MAKE IT
ALL AVAILABLE FOR ANALYTICS AND
MACHINE LEARNING. WE ALSO OFFER
EIGHT RELATIONAL DATABASES,
INCLUDING AMAZON, AURORA THE
RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICE
THAT'S BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP
FOR THE CLOUD AND IS STILL THE
FASTEST GROWING SERVICE IN AWS
HISTORY. WE ALSO HAVE EIGHT
PURPOSE BUILT DATABASES, NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES, INCLUDING
AMAZON DYNAMODB, WHICH IS USED
BY OVER A MILLION DEVELOPERS
SORRY, A MILLION CUSTOMERS FOR
ITS SERVERLESS SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND PERFORMANCE AT ANY
SCALE. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE
BROADEST AND DEEPEST SET OF
ANALYTICS SERVICES AND THIS
INCLUDES OUR DATA WAREHOUSE
SERVICE, AMAZON REDSHIFT, WHICH
DELIVERS UP TO SIX OR EVEN SEVEN
TIMES BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
DEPENDING ON YOUR WORKLOAD THAN
OTHER CLOUD DATA WAREHOUSES.
WE'VE GOT AMAZON EMR TO EASILY
RUN SPARK AND OTHER BIG DATA
WORKLOADS AND AMAZON OPENSEARCH
SERVICE WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF ACTIVE CUSTOMERS AND HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF CLUSTERS UNDER
MANAGEMENT. AND THAT ALL
PROCESSES TRILLIONS OF REQUESTS
PER MONTH AND MANY, MANY, MANY
MORE ANALYTIC SERVICES. I WON'T
GO THROUGH THEM ALL, BUT YOU
NEED THIS BREADTH AND THIS DEPTH
OF CHOICE SO THAT YOU CAN NEVER
HAVE TO COMPROMISE ON COST, ON
PERFORMANCE OR ON SCALE, AND
INSTEAD YOU CAN CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOL FOR THE JOB. NOW, WE'VE
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT AI AND ML
EXTENSIVELY, SO I'M NOT GOING TO
DWELL ON THAT HERE. BUT YOU NEED
TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOLS TO FEED YOUR AI AND
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'RE
DOING IN YOUR BUSINESS. AND THE
SECOND THING THAT YOU NEED AS
YOU MOVE TO PUT DATA AT THE
CENTER OF YOUR BUSINESS IS TO
BREAK DOWN YOUR DATA SILOS. MOST
PEOPLE HAVE DATA SPREAD OUT ALL
OVER THE ORGANIZATION IN
DATABASES, ANALYTIC TOOLS, SAAS
APPLICATIONS, SPREADSHEETS AND
MORE. AND TO GET THE MOST VALUE
FROM YOUR DATA, YOU NEED TO BE
ABLE TO USE IT ALL. NO MATTER
WHERE IT LIVES. AND TO DO THIS
TODAY, MOST PEOPLE MOVE DATA
AROUND OR TRY TO CONNECT THE
VARIOUS SILOS USING A PROCESS
CALLED ETL OR EXTRACT, TRANSFORM
AND LOAD. YEAH, I SEE SOME OF
YOU FLINCHED WHEN I SAID THAT
BECAUSE YOU KNOW. RIGHT. YOU
KNOW EXACTLY HOW BAD THIS
PROCESS CAN BE. IT IS TEARING
ALL FIRST DEVELOPERS HAVE TO
DESIGN AN ETL PIPELINE
ARCHITECTURE. THEY HAVE TO
DECIDE WHERE TO EXTRACT THE DATA
FROM, AND IT'S OFTEN COMING FROM
MULTIPLE SOURCES. THEN THEY HAVE
TO WRITE CODE TO TRANSFORM THE
DATA AND REMOVE DUPLICATES. THEY
HAVE TO FILTER OUT OUTLIERS,
RETRIEVE MISSING DATA AND
IDENTIFY CORRUPTED DATA. AFTER
ALL THAT, YOU HAVE TO TRANSFORM.
YOU HAVE TO LOAD YOUR TRANSFORM
DATA TO ITS NEW DESTINATION,
WHICH ONCE AGAIN MEANS MORE CODE
TO WRITE. THEN, IF SOMETHING
CHANGES, LIKE A DATA ENGINEER
SWAPPING OUT A DATA TABLE OR
ADDING A NEW FIELD, YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK AGAIN AND UPDATE ALL OF
YOUR CODE ONCE MORE. IT IS
MONOTONOUS, IT IS TEDIOUS AND IT
IS JUST A WHOLE LOT OF UNFUN
WORK, WHICH IS WHY WE INTRODUCED
OUR VISION OF A ZERO ETL FUTURE
FOR AND IN THIS FUTURE YOU CAN
WAVE GOODBYE TO THE BORING,
FRUSTRATING PROCESS OF ETL. YOUR
DATA IS AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTED
FROM THE SOURCE TO THE
DESTINATION. IT'S THAT EASY AND
YOU GET YOUR DATA WHERE YOU NEED
IT WHEN YOU NEED IT. NO MORE
BUILDING AND MANAGING COMPLEX,
BRITTLE PROCESSES AND PIPELINES.
IT'S REALLY EXCITING. BUT IS IT
REAL? WELL, IS IT DOWN PAYMENT?
LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED A FULLY
MANAGED ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
BETWEEN AURORA, MYSQL AND
REDSHIFT. WITHIN SECONDS OF DATA
BEING WRITTEN INTO AURORA, YOU
CAN USE REDSHIFT TO DO NEAR REAL
TIME ANALYTICS AND ON PETABYTES
OF DATA. YOU CAN ENABLE THIS
INTEGRATION WITH JUST A FEW
CLICKS AND ZERO-ETL. IT IS
INCREDIBLY EASY NOW THIS FIRST
ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IS READY,
IS READY DONE. BUT WE'VE WE'VE
WE WANT TO DELIVER SO MUCH MORE.
AND SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TODAY
TO BE ANNOUNCING THREE MORE ZERO
ETL INTEGRATIONS WITH REDSHIFT.
LET'S GET THEM ALL DONE AT ONCE.
AURORA POSTGRES RDS FOR MYSQL
AND DYNAMODB. THESE ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS AND AMAZON REDSHIFT
ARE ALL AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW
WHEN TODAY. SO. SO THAT MAKES.
YEAH. YOU DON'T LIKE THE MUCK,
DO YOU? SO THAT'S FOUR OF OUR
MOST POPULAR RELATIONAL AND NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES TOGETHER
WITH THE DATA WAREHOUSE THAT
GIVES YOU THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITHOUT ANY OF THE
ETL FANTASTIC. BUT REMEMBER,
WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THIS VISION.
SO OF COURSE OUR NEXT QUESTION
WAS, WELL, WHERE ELSE COULD WE
BE REMOVING THE PAIN OF ETL?
NOW, MANY OF YOU NEED TO USE
SEARCH ON YOUR TRANSACTIONAL
DATA TO ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE
OF YOUR APPLICATION. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE AN
E-COMMERCE APPLICATION AND YOU
WANT TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED
RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOUR USER,
YOU USE SIMILARITY SEARCH ON
TRANSACTION DATA. THAT'S GOING
TO BE STORED IN YOUR DATABASE.
SO TO DO THIS CURRENTLY YOU'RE
DESIGNING, YOU'RE BUILDING,
YOU'RE MANAGING COMPLEX DATA
PIPELINE ARCHITECTURES FROM YOUR
DATABASE TO A SEARCH ENGINE. AND
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOU ARE
BUILDING THOSE PIPELINES TO
AMAZON OPENSEARCH SERVICE FOR
ITS POWERFUL SEARCH CAPABILITIES
. I BET YOU CAN TELL WHERE WE'RE
GOING WITH THIS. SO TODAY I'M
REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE UNVEILED
ONE MORE ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IN
DYNAMO. DB ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
WITH OPENSEARCH SERVICE
GENERALLY AVAILABLE TODAY. AND
THIS NEW INTEGRATION MAKES IT SO
EASY TO SEARCH DYNAMODB DATA
WITH OUR OPENSEARCH SERVICE. AND
IT'S JUST THE FIRST OF THESE
DATABASE INTEGRATIONS TO OUR
OPENSEARCH SERVICE THAT'S GOING
TO HELP YOU DO MORE WITH DATA.
SO OUR NEW ZERO-ETL INTEGRATIONS
ARE BRINGING TRANSACTIONAL DATA
AND ANALYTICS TOGETHER FASTER
AND MORE EASILY AND CUSTOMERS
ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE
IDEA OF A ZERO-ETL FUTURE. SO
YOU CAN BE CERTAIN WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP INNOVATING HERE. NOW
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE
TOOLS THAT YOU NEED AND HOW YOU
CAN HAVE DATA WHERE YOU NEED IT
WITHOUT THE PAINFUL ETL BURDEN.
NEXT YOU WANT TO EMPOWER PEOPLE
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION TO USE
YOUR DATA TO ITS FULLEST AND YOU
WANT THEM WALLOWING IN YOUR
DATA, EXPERIMENTING, ASKING
QUESTIONS, SPARKING IDEAS. AND
YOU WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS.
BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM YOUR
DATA IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE, SO
YOU WANT TO GRANT ACCESS ONLY TO
THE RIGHT EMPLOYEES AT THE RIGHT
TIME. YOU NEED TO KEEP IT SAFE
AND SECURE. SO YOU ALSO NEED
CONTROL, YOUR ACCESS CONTROL.
KOHL THESE ARE OPPOSITES, RIGHT?
NO, YOU CAN HAVE IN FACT, YOU
MUST HAVE BOTH AND THE KEY TO
MAKING SURE THAT YOUR DATA IS,
IS SAFE, IS GOVERNED, HAS ACCESS
, IS GOVERNANCE CREATING
VISIBILITY INTO YOUR DATA AND
CONTROLLING WHO CAN ACCESS YOUR
DATA AND WHEN THEY CAN ACCESS IT
WITH ROBUST GOVERNANCE, YOU'RE
GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO
THE DATA THEY NEED AND ONLY THAT
DATA. AND WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT
DATA YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW WHERE IT
IS. YOU HAVE GUARDRAILS AND
TOOLS IN PLACE TO SAFELY UNLOCK
IT. THAT BUILDS CONFIDENCE. AND
THEN PEOPLE WITHIN THE
ORGANIZATION DEVELOP TRUST IN
THE DATA. YOU ACTUALLY EMPOWER
INNOVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION
RATHER THAN STIFLING IT. AND SO
TO HELP YOU WITH GOVERNANCE, WE
DEVELOPED AMAZON DATAZONE DATA
ZONES, A DATA MANAGEMENT SERVICE
THAT HELPS YOU CATALOG,
DISCOVER, SHARE AND GOVERN DATA
ACROSS YOUR ORGANIZATION. WE'RE
GETTING GREAT FEEDBACK FROM LOTS
OF DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
LEADER IN BRAZIL, ITAU. AND
WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE
IMPACT THAT DATA ZONE IS HAVING
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY IN THIS SPACE.
TODAY, DATA ZONE USES MACHINE
LEARNING TO AUTOMATICALLY ADD
METADATA TO YOUR CATALOG, BUT IN
ORDER TO FIND THE RIGHT DATA AT
THE RIGHT TIME, CUSTOMERS STILL
HAVE TO CHOOSE TO ADD BUSINESS
CONTEXT LIKE EXPLAINING THE
DATA'S PURPOSE OR CLARIFYING THE
COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS. AND NOW
THIS HELPS EMPLOYEES FIND THE
DATA THAT THEY NEED. IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
KNOW THE DATA EXISTS, THE
QUESTION OF ACCESS AND CONTROL
BECOMES MOOT. BUT ADDING ALL
THIS DATA IS A METADATA IS
TEDIOUS. IT'S A MANUAL PROCESS.
WELL, NO LONGER. WE'RE MAKING
YOUR CATALOGING EVEN SMARTER.
AND TODAY I'M REALLY PLEASED TO
ANNOUNCE A NEW CAPABILITY THAT
AUTOMATICALLY SUGGESTS BUSINESS
DESCRIPTIONS TO ADD CONTEXT FOR
YOUR DATA SET IN JUST A FEW
CLICKS, CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS
SIMPLY CHOOSE A DATA SET AND
DATAZONE WILL USE GENERATIVE AI
TO CREATE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS
FOR YOUR DATA. USING OUR TRAINED
MODELS. MAKING IT EASIER TO
UNDERSTAND THESE DESCRIPTIONS
CAN BE REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED, OR
EVEN FURTHER CLARIFIED OR EDITED
FOR YOUR EXACT PREFERENCES. DATA
ZONES ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO USE
YOUR DATA. THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE
TIME SAVER IN THIS CAPABILITY IS
GOING TO HELP EMPLOYEES TO FIND
THE RIGHT DATA FOR EVEN FASTER
INSIGHTS. WE'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE TO HELP YOU
USE DATA GOVERNANCE TO SET YOUR
DATA FREE. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
DO IN YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED AN
END TO END DATA STRATEGY THAT
PROVIDES CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE
ENTIRE SPAN OF YOUR DATA NEEDS.
YOU NEED TO EASILY CONNECT DATA
ACROSS SILOS AND YOU NEED YOU
NEED YOUR DATA TO BE GOVERNED TO
BE CONFIDENT THAT THE RIGHT DATA
IS USED IN THE RIGHT WAYS BY
ONLY THE RIGHT PEOPLE. WE'RE
MAKING AWS THE BEST PLACE FOR
ALL OF YOUR DATA NEEDS ACROSS
ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS.
AND WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS AND
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO MAKE DATA,
YOUR DIFFERENTIATOR IN AI AND
ACROSS YOUR BUSINESS, IT'S
AMAZING. WE'VE TALKED A LOT
ABOUT REINVENTION TODAY AND HERE
AT AWS THE MOST IMPORTANT
REINVENTION OF ALL IS YOURS TO
SUPPORT YOU IN ALL THE WAYS THAT
YOU WANT TO ADAPT AND EVOLVE. WE
CONTINUOUSLY CONTINUE TO
CHALLENGE OURSELVES. WE TRY AND
THINK DIFFERENTLY. WE TRY AND
GIVE YOU THE CAPABILITY WIZ THAT
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED, AND EVEN
SOME MAYBE THAT YOU'VE NEVER
IMAGINED. NOW, THIS ISN'T THE
WORK OF A FEW MONTHS OR EVEN A
YEAR, BUT WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT.
WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE AT
AMAZON WE MAKE BOLD BETS. SO
THIRD PARTY SELLING ON AMAZON
PRIME, EVEN AWS ITSELF IS A BIG
BET. I MEAN, IT TOOK A LOT OF
YEARS AND A LOT OF CAPITAL TO
BUILD OUT THE ON DEMAND
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES THAT
SIMPLY BECAME KNOWN AS THE CLOUD
FOR THIS LONG TERM FOCUS IS A
GOOD THING. BEING WILLING TO
THINK DIFFERENTLY AND LONG TERM
IS A GOOD THING. IT'S THE ONLY
PREDICTABLE WAY TO PROFOUNDLY
CHANGE WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR
CUSTOMERS. AWS. NOW THERE'S
ANOTHER BIG BET THAT AMAZON IS
MAKING YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF
PROJECT KUIPER AND YEAH, KUIPER.
KUIPER'S BUILDING A
CONSTELLATION OF THOUSANDS OF
LOW EARTH ORBIT SATELLITES. WHY?
WELL, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE ON EARTH LACK FAST OR
RELIABLE OR EVEN ANY INTERNET
ACCESS. PROJECT KUIPER IS GOING
TO HELP CLOSE THAT DIGITAL
DIGITAL DIVIDE BY DELIVERING
FAST, AFFORDABLE BROADBAND TO A
WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS
OPERATING IN PLACES WITHOUT
RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTIONS.
IN FACT, JUST LAST MONTH, KUIPER
, THE KUIPER TEAM SUCCESSFULLY
LAUNCHED ITS FIRST TWO PROTOSTAR
SATELLITES INTO ORBIT. IT'S JUST
INCREDIBLE THING. I MEAN, THEY
PUT SATELLITES UP THERE. THEY'RE
WORKING FLAWLESSLY. EVERYBODY'S
REALLY HAPPY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED
THERE RIGHT? WOW I MEAN, KUIPER
IS A GLOBAL HIGH SPEED SATELLITE
NETWORK THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE
COVERAGE IN PLACES THAT HAVE
NEVER HAD COVERAGE BEFORE. I
MEAN, IMAGINE THE POWER OF
DELIVERING A REALLY HARD TO
REACH PLACES, THE ABILITY TO
ACCESS THE INTERNET WITH THE
SAME SPEED. THE SAME RELIABILITY
THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED
EVERY DAY. NOW, THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR CONSUMERS IS,
FOR SURE, ENORMOUS. BUT SO ARE
THE BENEFITS TO BUSINESSES AND
GOVERNMENTS. AND THERE ARE ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES LIKE
RENEWABLE ENERGY PROVIDERS THAT
WANT TO ANALYZE IN REAL TIME
DATA FROM OFF SHORE WIND FARMS
OR FIRST RESPONDERS WHO NEED
FAST, RELIABLE CONNECTIONS
DURING NATURAL DISASTERS OR
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LOOKING
FOR CONNECTIVITY, BACKUP IN CASE
OF AN UNPLANNED OUTAGE. KUIPER
IS GOING TO HELP TO MAKE ALL OF
THIS POSSIBLE AND AWS CUSTOMERS
ARE ALREADY PLANNING FOR THE
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS OPENS UP
TO CONNECT TO THEIR FACILITIES,
THEIR SENSORS, THEIR DATA, THEIR
NETWORKS. IT'S GOING TO BE
AMAZING FOR SO MANY CUSTOMERS,
BUT SOME CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
DON'T WANT THEIR DATA RUNNING
OVER THE PUBLIC INTERNET. AND AS
YOU KNOW, SECURITY IS ALWAYS OUR
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. SO TODAY,
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THAT IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, KUIPER IS
ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE ENTERPRISE
READY PRIVATE CONNECTIVITY
SERVICES. AND NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE DATA FROM
VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE OVER PRIVATE
SECURE CONNECTIONS. AND AS YOU
USE USE THESE CONNECTIONS WITH
YOUR DATA, YOU CAN USE IT INSIDE
OF THE AWS CLOUD TO AN EARLY
ADOPTERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
START TESTING IN THE SECOND HALF
OF 2024. SO WE MAKE BIG BETS
LIKE THESE SO THAT CUSTOMERS CAN
DO THINGS THAT THEY COULDN'T
IMAGINE BEFORE. AND YOU COME ON
THIS JOURNEY WITH US BECAUSE
WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THESE
KINDS OF AUDACIOUS LEAPS AND THE
BENEFITS HAVE BEEN ENORMOUS. THE
EXCITING CHALLENGE AHEAD OF ALL
OF US THIS NEXT YEAR IS TO LOOK
CLOSELY AT OUR WORK AND TO
REIMAGINE IT, TO REINVENT IT, TO
DREAM UP EXPERIENCES THAT WERE
PREVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE AND MAKE
THEM REAL. WE ARE SO EXCITED TO
BE YOUR PARTNER IN THIS NEW
WORLD THAT WE'RE BUILDING
TOGETHER, AND I'M THRILLED THAT
WE GET TO EXPLORE IT. ALL THIS
WEEK. THIS MORNING. IT'S BEEN
INCREDIBLE. I WANT TO THANK ALL
OF MY GUESTS ON STAGE TODAY AND
THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WATCHING
AND OF COURSE, THANK YOU TO THE
WHOLE AWS TEAM FOR WORKING SO
HARD TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. NOW,
THE TEAM DOES HAVE ONE MORE
LITTLE SURPRISE UP UP THEIR
COLLECTIVE SLEEVE. SO I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE VERY
BEGINNING I MENTIONED LOUD AND
GUITARS IN IRELAND, BUT WE
ACTUALLY HAVE A LOUD GUITAR HERE
FROM OUR FRIENDS AT LOUDEN AND
WE'VE INVITED A TALENTED
GUITARIST A LONG TIME AWS
FAVORITE ZACH PERSON TO PLAY US
OUT. SO WE HAVE GOT A GREAT
CONFERENCE HERE FOR YOU THIS
WEEK. NOW LET'S GET OUT THERE
AND REINVENT. THANK YOU. NOW
TAKE IT AWAY, ZACH.
PLEASE WELCOME THE CEO OF AWS,
ADAM SELIPSKY.
GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE
12TH ANNUAL REINVENT. I AM SO
HAPPY TO BE HERE WITH MORE THAN
50,000 OF YOU HERE IN LAS VEGAS
AND MORE THAN 300,000 WATCHING
AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR
JOINING. THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU
. NOW, WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THIS
EVENT JUST A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENTLY AND REINVENT REMAINS
ABOVE ALL, A LEARNING
CONFERENCE, A LEARNING EVENT,
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN
AND GROW HERE ARE EVERYWHERE.
WE'VE GOT MORE THAN 2200
SESSIONS, AND YOU CAN CONNECT
WITH AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
PARTNERS IN THE EXPO ALL AROUND.
AND OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY,
MANY OPPORTUNITY WIZ TO CONNECT
WITH FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE AWS
COMMUNITY. SO WE'VE ALSO GOT A
GREAT SLATE OF KEYNOTES FOR YOU.
YESTERDAY, LAST NIGHT, HOPEFULLY
A LOT OF YOU SAW PETER DIVE INTO
ALL OF OUR INNOVATION AROUND
SERVERLESS. AND TOMORROW WE'VE
GOT SWAMI ON AI AND MACHINE
LEARNING AS WELL AS RUBA'S
PARTNER KEYNOTE. AND THEN OF
COURSE, WERNER CAPS OFF THE WEEK
ON THURSDAY. BUT I'M EXTREMELY
EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE IN
STORE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW HERE
TODAY. SO LET'S GET STARTED. SO
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT
REINVENT IS THE SHEER VARIETY OF
THE CUSTOMERS THAT I GET TO
MEET. I MEAN, FOLKS FROM EVERY
INDUSTRY, EVERY REGION, EVERY
USE CASE. AND THERE'S JUST
NOTHING LIKE IT ANYWHERE FOR AN
INNOVATORS ALL OVER THE WORLD
ARE RELYING ON AWS TO DRIVE
THEIR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING
LEADING ENTERPRISES FROM ACROSS
EVERY INDUSTRY, JUST TO NAME A
FEW IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE'RE
WORKING WITH JPMORGAN CHASE.
WE'RE WORKING WITH GOLDMAN
SACHS, NASDAQ, FIDELITY, ALLIANZ
ITYOU, BBVA, HSBC, GE CAPITAL
ONE, S&P GLOBAL NUBANK AND MORE.
IN HEALTH CARE, WE'RE WORKING
WITH PFIZER, GILEAD, MERCK, NOVO
NORDISK ROCHE, MODERNA, ILLUMINA
. MEDTRONIC 3M HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MORE. IN
AUTOMOTIVE, WE'RE WORKING WITH
EVERYBODY FROM BMW TO STELLANTIS
HONDA, TOYOTA, VW GROUP, NISSAN,
HYUNDAI, FORD MOTOR COMPANY,
MERCEDES BENZ, AND OF COURSE,
MORE. SO MANY AMAZING CUSTOMERS
AND PARTNERS AND STILL JUST A
SMATTERING OF THE LEADERS WE'RE
WORKING WITH TO SHAPE THE
FUTURES OF THESE INDUSTRIES. AND
ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
THAT THEY SERVE. ONE CUSTOMER
AND PARTNER. WE'VE BEEN WORKING
CLOSELY WITH FOR A NUMBER OF
YEARS IS SALESFORCE. SO IN 2016,
SALESFORCE CHOSE AWS AS THEIR
PRIMARY CLOUD PROVIDER, AND
TODAY SALESFORCE USES AWS
COMPUTE STORAGE DATA SERVICE AS
MANY OTHERS TO POWER KEY
SERVICES LIKE SALESFORCE, DATA
CLOUD AND MANY OTHERS. AND
YESTERDAY WE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
OUR PARTNERSHIP TO BRING NEW
CAPABILITIES TO OUR MUTUAL
CUSTOMERS. SALESFORCE IS GOING
TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING
ITS ALREADY VERY LARGE USE OF
AWS. AWS WILL BE USING MORE
SALESFORCE TECHNOLOGIES AND
WE'RE MAKING IT EASIER FOR
DEVELOPERS TO QUICKLY BUILD AND
DEPLOY GENERATIVE AI
APPLICATIONS. JENS BY BRINGING
TOGETHER AMAZON BEDROCK WITH
SALESFORCE'S EINSTEIN PLATFORM.
WE'RE ALSO HELPING TO UNIFY DATA
MANAGEMENT WITH OUR NEW ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS BETWEEN SALESFORCE
DATA CLOUD AND AWS STORAGE AND
COMPUTE AND DATA SERVICE DATA
AND ANALYTICS SERVICES. SO THE
CUSTOMERS CAN GET EVEN BETTER
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND WE'RE ALSO
BUILDING TIGHTER INTEGRATIONS
BETWEEN SERVICE CLOUD FROM
SALESFORCE AND AMAZON CONNECT.
ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME,
SALESFORCE IS GOING TO BE
PUTTING ITS PRODUCTS ON THE
MARKET PLACE, MAKING IT EVEN
EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO FIND, TO
BUY AND TO MANAGE SALESFORCE
OFFERINGS. SO WITH THIS EXPANDED
PARTNERSHIP AND SALESFORCE
CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO GET NEW,
POWERFUL WAYS TO INNOVATE AND
BUILD APPLICATIONS. BUT IT'S NOT
JUST GLOBAL ENTERPRISE IS THE
MOST PROMISING UP AND COMER ALSO
CONTINUE TO CHOOSE AWS AS WELL.
ACCORDING TO PITCHBOOK, THERE
ARE MORE THAN 1000 UNICORNS OR
STARTUPS WITH OVER $1 BILLION IN
VALUATION, AND THE VAST MAJORITY
OF UNICORNS OVER 80% CHOOSE AWS
LIKE WIZ, A CLOUD SECURITY
COMPANY AND GREAT AWS PARTNER.
WIZ IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST CYBER
SECURITY UNICORN AND FASTEST
SAAS COMPANY. TO REACH A $10
BILLION VALUATION. REALLY
AMAZING OR ULTIMATE GENOMICS,
ONE OF FAST COMPANY'S MOST
INNOVATIVE COMPANIES IN BIOTECH
AND ULTIMO IS REVOLUTIONIZING
DNA SEQUENCING BY REDUCING THE
COST OF SEQUENCING SIX FOLD OR
PLAID PLAIDS. A DATA STARTUP
THAT POWERS FINTECH TOOLS LIKE
VENMO, ACORN AND ROBINHOOD THAT
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE USING TO
MANAGE THEIR FINANCES. CUSTOMERS
OF EVERY SIZE, EVERY INDUSTRY,
ORI, EVERY REGION, ORGANIZATIONS
YOU MIGHT NEVER IMAGINE CHAN
WOULD RELY ON THE CLOUD ARE
INNOVATING ON AWS. I JUST
RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT LOUDEN
GUITARS, A K10 EXPERT GUITAR
MAKER LOCATED IN A TINY VILLAGE
IN IRELAND, AND THEY'RE USING
AWS TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN
ELECTRONIC PASSPORT PROGRAM
THAT'S GOING TO EASE THE PASSAGE
OF THEIR VERY SPECIAL GUITARS
FOR MUSICIANS AS THEY TRAVEL
THROUGH CUSTOMS. I MEAN, ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES. IT'S AMAZING
ENTERPRISE WIZ AND STARTUPS,
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED
BUSINESSES, UNIVERSITIES,
COMMUNITY COLLEGES, GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, NONPROFITS. THE CLOUD
IS FOR ANYONE AND OUR CUSTOMERS
ARE SOLVING BIG PROBLEMS,
SERVING CRITICAL NEEDS AND
DREAMING UP THE WORLD'S NEXT BIG
THING. THEY COUNT ON US TO BE
SECURE, TO BE RELIABLE, TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY, TO DELIGHT
THEIR CUSTOMERS AND ENABLE NEW
WAYS TO GROW THEIR BUSINESSES.
ALL ALL ON AWS. SO WHY IS ALL
THIS HAPPENING? ON AWS, WE ARE
RELENTLESS ABOUT WORKING
BACKWARDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS
NEEDS AND FROM THEIR PAIN
POINTS. AND OF COURSE WE WERE
THE FIRST BY ABOUT 5 TO 7 YEARS
TO HAVE THIS BROADEST AND
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES THAT
WE STILL HAVE TODAY. AND WE'RE
THE MOST SECURE AND THE MOST
RELIABLE, BUT WE ALSO THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS
PROBLEMS AND THEIR POTENTIAL.
AND THIS HAS LED US TO REINVENT
CONTINUOUS ALI, TO PUSH THROUGH
THE BARRIERS OF WHAT PEOPLE
THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. SO YOU CAN
DO THE SAME. REINVENTING IS IN
OUR DNA AND IT CONTINUES TO
DRIVE US EVERY DAY. AFTER ALL,
THIS IS HOW CLOUD COMPUTING CAME
TO BE. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF
OPERATING OPERATING AMAZON.COM.
WE EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND HOW
HARD, HOW EXPENSIVE IT WAS TO
PROVISION AND MANAGE
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW MUCH OF
THE UNDIFFERENTIATED HEAVY
LIFTING THERE WAS THAT
DISTRACTED, REALLY TALENTED
TEAMS FROM REALLY INNOVATING. SO
WE SET OUT TO RETHINK IT.
INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETELY WITH
AWS. SO EVERYONE, EVEN A KID AND
A COLLEGE DORM ROOM, COULD HAVE
ACCESS TO THE SAME POWERFUL
TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO THE
LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED
ORGANIZATIONS. ALL ON DEMAND,
ALL SECURE, ALL RELIABLE AND ALL
COST EFFECTIVE. NOW IF FOLKS GOT
PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AS
THEY MOVED INTO THE CLOUD, SOME
EVEN HOSTED DATA CENTER CLOSING
PARTIES AND POSTED VIDEOS OF
SHUTTING DOWN SERVER ROOMS. IT
WAS REALLY, REALLY FUN. THIS WAS
FUN FOR US. SO WE INVENTED
REINVENTED INFRASTRUC FROM THE
GROUND UP TO OPTIMIZE AWS FOR
SCALE, FOR SECURITY, FOR
RELIABILITY, FROM ROUTERS TO
COOLING SYSTEMS TO NETWORKING
PROTOCOLS. AND BECAUSE WE LOOK
AT THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, OUR
GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE WAS
FUNDAMENTALLY DISTINCT FROM THAT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS. AND
THAT IS STILL TRUE TODAY. FOR
EXAMPLE, THE AWS GLOBAL
INFRASTRUCTURE SPANS 32
GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AROUND THE
WORLD AND WE'VE ANNOUNCED PLANS
FOR FIVE OR SO MORE EACH AND
EVERY REGION CONSISTS OF THREE
OR MORE AVAILABILITY ZONES OR
AZS AND NO OTHER CLOUD PROVIDER
PROVIDES THAT IN EVERY SINGLE
GEOGRAPHIC REGION. AND THIS IS
CRITICAL WITH EACH REGION. THE
AZS ARE PHYSICALLY SEPARATED BY
A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE UP TO 60
MILES OR 100KM. AND THEN THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH REDUNDANT
FIBER NETWORK THAT PROVIDES
SINGLE DIGIT MILLISECOND
LATENCY. NOW EACH AZ IS AT LEAST
ONE FULLY DISCRETE DATA CENTER
WITH ITS OWN REDUNDANT POWER
WATER FOR NETWORKING AND
CONNECTIVITY. SO IF THERE'S A
UTILITY FAILURE, UNEXPECTED
TRAFFIC SPIKE, HUMAN MISTAKE OR
EVEN A NATURAL DISASTER, THE
REGION REMAINS OPERATIONAL AND
SO DO YOUR APPLICATIONS. NOW,
OTHERS WOULD HAVE YOU THINK THAT
ALL CLOUDS ARE THE SAME, BUT
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. I MEAN,
IMAGINE IF YOU HAD A REGION
SUPPORTED BY A SINGLE DATA
CENTER OR IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR
PROVIDER HAD MULTIPLE AZS IN
FRANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND YOU
WERE RESILIENT. BUT IT TURNED
OUT THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THE
SAME LOCATION. I MEAN, ONE
INCIDENT LIKE A WATER LEAK
FOLLOWED BY A FIRE COULD TAKE
DOWN AN ENTIRE REGION FOR DAYS
DUE. HAVING THE BROADEST AND THE
DEEPEST SET OF CAPABILITIES
MATTERS LIKE HAVING THREE TIMES
THE THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF
DATA CENTERS COMPARED TO THE
NEXT LARGEST CLOUD PROVIDER,
WHICH MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN
CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY AND
HAVING 60% MORE SERVICES IN OVER
40% MORE FEATURES THAN THE NEXT
CLOSEST CLOUD PROVIDER. SO YOU
CAN INNOVATE WITHOUT
CONSTRAINTS. WE REINVENT IT SO
THAT YOU CAN REINVENT, TAKE
STORAGE, FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE
CERTAINLY DIDN'T INVENT STORAGE,
BUT WE REINVENTED HOW PEOPLE
CONSUME AND SCALE STORAGE IN THE
CLOUD WITH OUR VERY FIRST CLOUD
SERVICE, AMAZON S3, SIMPLE
STORAGE SERVICE SO BACK IN THE
DAY, STORAGE WAS PRIMARILY DISK
ARRAYS, WHICH COULD TAKE WEEKS
TO PROVISION AND OBVIOUSLY HAD
FINITE CAPACITY. SO S3 PROVIDED
HIGHLY DURABLE, HIGHLY
PERFORMANT OBJECT STORAGE THAT
CUSTOMERS COULD SCALE INSTANTLY
AND NEARLY INFINITELY. AND I
REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT S3 AT OUR
VERY FIRST TRADE SHOW IN 2006,
ON THE DAY THAT IT LAUNCHED, AND
FOLKS HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING
THE COST. I MEAN, IT WAS SO
DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN WHAT
THEY WERE USED TO, BUT WE KEPT
GOING. WE ADDED A WHOLE LOT OF
STORAGE TIERS, INCLUDING S3
GLACIER, DEEP ARCHIVE, WHICH
DELIVERS ARCHIVE STORAGE AT LESS
THAN A 10TH OF A CENT PER
GIGABYTE. BUT WHY SHOULD YOU
HAVE TO EVEN FIGURE OUT WHICH
STORAGE TIER TO USE? SO WE BUILT
S3 INTELLIGENT-TIERING TO
OPTIMIZE STORAGE BY
AUTOMATICALLY MOVING DATA TO THE
MOST EFFECTIVE ACCESS TIER WHEN
ACCESS PATTERNS CHANGE.
INTELLIGENT-TIERING HAS ALREADY
SAVED CUSTOMERS. YOU READY? OVER
$2 BILLION, BUT IT'S JUST
STORAGE, RIGHT? I MEAN, HERE'S
TO THE SAVINGS. BUT STORAGE,
RIGHT? I MEAN, SURELY THIS CAN'T
BE AN AREA THAT'S READY FOR MORE
REINVENTION. WELL, RECENTLY
WE'VE BEEN RETHINKING STORAGE
FOR YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED AND MOST LATENCY
SENSITIVE WORKLOADS, WORKLOADS
THAT NEED HIGH PERFORMANCE
ANALYTICS PROCESSING, LIKE
FINANCIAL TRADING ANALYTICS,
REAL TIME ADVERTISING, FRAUD
DETECTION AND MACHINE LEARNING
TRAINING. NOW THESE WORKLOADS
ACCESS DATA UP TO MILLIONS OF
TIMES IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AND
DO REQUIRE SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. AND SO
TODAY WHAT HAPPENS IS CUSTOMERS
MOVE DATA OFTEN FROM S3 TO
CUSTOM CACHING SOLUTIONS AND
THEN RUN ANALYTICS AT THESE
SPEEDS. BUT MANAGING MULTIPLE
STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURES AND APIS
ADDS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY. SO WE
LOOKED HARD AT WHAT WE COULD DO
TO ADD TO S3 OKAY, ARE YOU READY
FOR THE FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF
THE DAY? OKAY SO TODAY I'M
EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE AMAZON S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE, A NEW S3
STORAGE CLASS PURPOSE BUILT.
PURPOSE BUILT TO OFFER THE
HIGHEST PERFORMANCE AND LOWEST
LATENCY CLOUD OBJECT FOR STORAGE
YOUR MOST FREQUENTLY ACCESSED
DATA. S3 EXPRESS ONE ZONE USES
PURPOSE BUILT HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE TO ACCELERATE DATA
PROCESSING. IT ALSO GIVES YOU
THE OPTION TO ACTUALLY CHOOSE
YOUR AZ FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND
YOU CAN BRING YOUR FREQUENTLY
ACCESSED DATA NEXT TO YOUR HIGH
PERFORMANCE COMPUTE RESOURCE WIZ
TO MINIMIZE LATENCY. SO S3
EXPRESS ONE ZONE SUPPORTS
MILLIONS OF REQUESTS PER MINUTE
WITH CONSISTENT SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND LATENCY. THE FASTEST
OBJECT STORAGE IN THE CLOUD AND
UP TO TEN TIMES FASTER THAN S3
STANDARD STORAGE. NOW THE FASTER
DATA PROCESSING LETS YOU SAVE UP
TO 60% ON YOUR COMPUTE COSTS AS
WELL. FOR WORKLOADS THAT REQUIRE
THE HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALYTICS
AND THE DATA ACCESS COSTS. ALSO
ARE 50% LOWER THAN S3 STANDARD.
SO YOU CAN RUN THESE WORKLOADS
AT MUCH, MUCH LOWER COST. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, WITH S3 EXPRESS, ONE
ZONE, PINTEREST HAS OBSERVED
OVER TEN TIMES FASTER RIDE
SPEEDS WHILE REDUCED THEIR TOTAL
COST BY 40% FOR ITS MACHINE
LEARNING POWERED VISUAL
INSPIRATION ENGINE. NOW THIS IS
ENABLING THEM TO DO FASTER
EXPERIMENTATION AND
PERSONALIZATION, IMPROVING
EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR USERS. SO
17 YEARS AGO, S3 REINVENTED
STORAGE BY LAUNCHING THE FIRST
CLOUD SERVICE FOR AWS AND WITH
S3 EXPRESS, ONE ZONE, YOU CAN
SEE S3 CONTINUING TO CHANGE HOW
DEVELOPERS USE STORAGE. THE SAME
SIMPLE INTERFACE AND SAME LOW
COST. AND NOW? NOW EVEN FASTER.
LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
REINVENTION. GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING. SO WE REALIZED ALMOST
TEN YEARS AGO THAT IF WE WANTED
TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE
ON PRICE PERFORMANCE FOR ALL OF
YOUR WORKLOADS, WE HAD TO
REINVENT GENERAL PURPOSE
COMPUTING FOR THE CLOUD ERA ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO THE SILICON AND
IN 2018, WE BECAME THE FIRST
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER TO DEVELOP
OUR OWN GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTE
PROCESSORS. WHEN WE ANNOUNCED
GRAVITON, OUR SERVER PROCESS OR
CHIP AND CUSTOMERS LOVE THE COST
SAVINGS THAT IT DELIVERED FOR
SCALE OUT WORKLOADS LIKE
MICROSERVICES AND WEB
APPLICATIONS, BUT ASKED FOR MORE
. SO WE BROUGHT YOU GRAVITON2,
WHICH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE SEVEN
FOLD FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF
WORKLOADS AND WE DIDN'T STOP
THERE. OUR CURRENT GENERATION.
GRAVITON THREE DELIVER IS UP TO
25. BETTER COMPUTE PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO GRAVITON2 AND THE
BEST PRICE PERFORMANCE IN EC2.
IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO USES 60%
LESS ENERGY FOR THE SAME LEVEL
OF PERFORMANCE AND THIS IS SO,
SO IMPORTANT TO SO MANY
CUSTOMERS TODAY. AND THAT'S
COMPARED TO COMPARABLE EC2
INSTANCES. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY
IS ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE
IMPORTANT. TODAY. WE'VE GOT OVER
150 GRAVITON BASED INSTANCES
ACROSS THE EC2 PORTFOLIO AND
MORE THAN 50,000 CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING ALL OF THE TOP 100 EC2
CUSTOMERS, USE GRAVITON BASED
INSTANCES TO REALIZE PRICE
PERFORMANCE BENEFITS. FOR
EXAMPLE, SAP, THEY'VE PARTNERED
WITH AWS TO ACTUALLY POWER SAP,
HANA CLOUD WITH GRAVITON AND
WITH GRAVITON. SAP HAS SEEN UP
TO 35% BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
FOR ANALYTICS WORKLOADS AND AIMS
TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT
. THEIR CARBON IMPACT BY AN
ESTIMATED 45. SUPER IMPRESSIVE
OF WE ARE RELENTLESS ABOUT
INNOVATION AND WE CONTINUE TO
PUSH THE ENVELOPE FURTHER. SO
TODAY I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THE LATEST GENERATION OF OUR
GRAVITON PROCESSOR AWS GRAVITON.
FOUR GRAVITON FOUR OR GRAVITON
FOUR IS THE MOST POWERFUL AND
THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT CHIP
THAT WE HAVE EVER BUILT, WITH
50% MORE CORES AND 75% MORE
MEMORY BANDWIDTH THAN GRAVITON.
THREE GRAVITON, FOUR CHIPS ARE
30% FASTER ON AVERAGE THAN
GRAVITON. THREE AND PERFORM EVEN
BETTER FOR CERTAIN WORKLOADS,
LIKE 40% FASTER FOR DATABASE
APPLICATIONS AND 45% FASTER FOR
JAVA APPLICATIONS AS WE WERE THE
FIRST TO DEVELOP AND OFFER OUR
OWN SERVER PROCESSORS, WE'RE NOW
IN OUR FOURTH GENERATION. IN
JUST FIVE YEARS. OTHER CLOUD
PROVIDERS HAVE NOT EVEN
DELIVERED ON THEIR FIRST SERVER
PROCESSORS YET. WE'RE ALSO
ANNOUNCING THE PREVIEW OF OUR
FIRST INSTANCE BASED ON GRAVITON
FOUR RAG INSTANCES AS RAG IS
PART OF OUR MEMORY OPTIMIZED
INSTANCE FAMILY. THEY'RE
DESIGNED TO DELIVER FAST, FAST
PERFORMANCE FOR WORKLOADS. THAT
PROCESS LARGE DATA SETS AND
MEMORY LIKE DATABASES OR REAL
TIME BIG DATA ANALYTICS. RAG
INSTANCES PROVIDE THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY
EFFICIENCY FOR MEMORY INTENSIVE
WORKLOADS AND THERE ARE MANY,
MANY MORE GRAVITON. FOUR
INSTANCES COMING HIGHLY RELIABLE
REGIONS WITH AVAILABILITY ZONES
DURABLE, INSTANTLY SCALABLE, LOW
COST STORAGE, LEADING PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITH CUSTOM DESIGNED
CHIPS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW
EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'RE
REINVENTING TO CONSTANTLY
DELIVER WHAT YOU NEED TO DRIVE
YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE, YOUR
INNOVATION, AND YOUR BUSINESSES.
AND FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES WE
HAVE BEEN SO INTENT ON PROVIDING
YOU WITH THE BROADEST AND
DEEPEST FUNCTIONALITY WITH THE
FAST PACE OF INNOVATION, THE
MOST RELIABLE, THE MOST SECURE
CLOUD SERVICES AND OF COURSE THE
LARGEST AND THE MOST DIVERSE
COMMUNITY OF CUSTOMERS AND
PARTNERS. NOW THESE ADVANTAGES
ARE ALWAYS RELEVANT, BUT NO MORE
SO THAN TODAY, BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALSO THE FOUNDATION FOR
REINVENTING WITH GENERATIVE AI I
NOW HERE TO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
THE BROADEST AND DEEPEST
CAPABILITIES, THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY AND
THE PRIVACY YOU TRUST. YOU NEED
AT ALL. AMAZON HAS BEEN
INNOVATING WITH AI FOR DECADES.
WE USE IT ACROSS THE COMPANY TO
OPTIMIZE THINGS LIKE OUR COMPANY
WIDE SUPPLY CHAIN TO CREATE
BETTER RETAIL SEARCH
CAPABILITIES, WIZ TO DELIVER NEW
EXPERIENCES LIKE AMAZON, ALEXA
OR OUR JUST WALK OUT SHOPPING
TECHNOLOGY. GENAI IS THE NEXT
STEP IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,
AND IT IS GOING TO REINVENT
EVERY APPLICATION THAT WE
INTERACT WITH AT WORK AND AT
HOME. WE'RE READY TO HELP YOU
REINVENT WITH GENERATIVE AI
BECAUSE AGAIN, WE THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES
TO MEET YOUR NEEDS AND WE
REINVENT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND
BECAUSE WE'RE INTIMATELY
FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT MEANS TO
REINVENT OURSELVES AS WE
UNDERSTAND HOW TO HELP YOU WITH
YOUR REINVENTIONS. FROM STARTUPS
TO ENTERPRISES, ORGANIZATIONS OF
ALL SIZES ARE GETTING GOING WITH
GENERATIVE AI. THEY WANT TO TAKE
THE MOMENTUM THAT THEY'RE
BUILDING WITH EARLY
EXPERIMENTATION AND TURN IT INTO
REAL WORLD PRODUCTIVITY GAINS
AND INNOVATE, INNOVATE,
INNOVATE. SO WE THINK ABOUT
GENERATIVE AI AS HAVING ACTUALLY
THREE MACRO LAYERS, IF YOU WILL,
OF A STACK. AND THEY'RE ALL
EQUALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE ARE
INVESTING IN ALL THREE OF THEM.
SO THE BOTTOM LAYER IS USED TO
TRAIN FOUNDATION MODELS, OTHER
AND LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, FMS,
WE'LL CALL THEM AND TO RUN THESE
MODELS IN PRODUCTION, THE MIDDLE
LAYER PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE LMS
AND OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
YOU NEED AND ALL THE TOOLS THAT
YOU NEED TO BUILD AND SCALE
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
THEM. AND THEN AT THE TOP LAYER,
WE'VE GOT APPLICATIONS THAT ARE
BUILT USING FMS SO THAT YOU CAN
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GENERATIVE AI
QUICKLY WITHOUT EVEN NEEDING ANY
SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE. SO LET'S
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LAYER
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WITH, WITH,
WITH THE FOUNDATION MODELS,
THERE ARE TWO MAIN TYPES OF
WORKLOADS TRAINING AND INFERENCE
AND TRAINING IS TO CREATE AND
PROVE FMS BY LEARNING PATTERNS
FROM LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRAINING,
DATA AND INFERENCE. USE THAT TO
RUN THE MODELS IN PRODUCTION TO
GENERATE AN OUTPUT SUCH AS TEXT
OR IMAGES OR VIDEO. AND THESE
WORKLOADS CONSUME MASSIVE
AMOUNTS OF COMPUTE POWER. SO TO
MAKE GENAI GENAI USE CASES
ECONOMICAL AND FEASIBLE, ALL YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR TRAINING, YOU
NEED TO RUN YOUR INFERENCE ON
INCREDIBLY PERFORMANT, COST
EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR ML AND AI. NOW
GPUS ARE THE CHIPS THAT CAN
PERFORM A HIGH VOLUME OF
MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS,
SIMULTANEOUS ALI MAKING THEM
POPULAR FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT
WORKLOADS FROM ML SIMULATIONS,
3D RENDERING. AND WE'VE BEEN
COLLABORATING WITH NVIDIA FOR
OVER 13 YEARS TO BRING GPUS TO
THE CLOUD BUILT ON COMPUTE
INSTANCES THAT SUPPORT A WIDE
RANGE OF USE CASES, INCLUDING
GRAPH SIX GAMING HPC, MACHINE
LEARNING, AND NOW OF COURSE
DEMAND AND GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS. IN 2010, AWS WAS THE
FIRST TO BRING NVIDIA GPUS TO
THE CLOUD WITH KG ONE OR THE
CLUSTER GPU INSTANCE. THEN WE
WERE THE FIRST TO OFFER NVIDIA V
100 GPUS WITH OUR P THREE
INSTANCES AND THEN WE WERE AGAIN
THE FIRST TO OFFER THE A 100
TENSOR CORE GPUS WITH OUR P FOUR
INSTANCES IN PRODUCTION AND
EARLIER THIS YEAR, YES, WE WERE
THE FIRST MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER
TO BRING NVIDIA H100 GPUS TO
MARKET WITH OUR P FIVE INSTANCES
AND THE P FIVE ARE PROVIDING
AMAZING PERFORMANCE FOR
TRAINING. THEY'RE UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER AND 40% LESS
EXPENSIVE THAN P FOUR SECONDS.
NOW HAVING THE BEST CHIPS IS
GREAT AND NECESSARY, BUT TO
DELIVER THE NEXT LEVEL OF
PERFORMANCE, YOU NEED MORE THAN
JUST THE BEST GPUS. YOU ALSO
NEED REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE
CLUSTERS OF SERVERS THAT ARE
RUNNING THESE GPUS. OUR GPU
INSTANCES CAN BE DEPLOYED IN EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND THEY'RE
INTERCONNECTED WITH UP TO 3200
GIGABITS PER SECOND OF
NETWORKING THROUGH OUR ELASTIC
FABRIC ADAPTER OR EFA. AND THIS
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
20,000 GPUS IN A SINGLE CLUSTER
FOR PROVIDING UP TO 20 EXAFLOPS
OF AGGREGATE COMPUTE COMPUTE
CAPACITY, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO
A SUPERCOMPUTER. AND ALL OF OUR
GPU INSTANCES THAT ARE RELEASED
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS ARE BASED
ON OUR BREAKTHROUGH NITRO
SYSTEM, WHICH REINVENT NOTED
VIRTUALIZATION BY OFFLOADING
STORAGE AND NETWORKING TO
SPECIALIZED CHIPS SO THAT ALL OF
THE SERVICE COMPUTE IS DEDICATED
TO RUNNING YOUR WORKLOADS. AND
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT OTHER
CLOUD PROVIDERS CAN OFFER. AGAIN
NOW WITH NITRO THIS DELIVERS
PERFORMANCE INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM BARE METAL, BUT AT A LOWER
PRICE. AND THE NITRO SYSTEM ALSO
PROVIDES ENHANCED SECURITY THAT
CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS AND
PROTECTS AND VERIFIES THAT THE
INSTANCE HARDWARE AND FIRMWARE
ARE ALL ROBUST. WE'VE WORKED
CLOSELY WITH NVIDIA TO INTEGRATE
OUR NETWORKING AND OUR
VIRTUALIZATION CAPABILITIES WITH
THEIR CHIPS TO BRING OUR GPU
INSTANCES TO CUSTOMERS AND TODAY
I'M THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE
ARE EXPANDING OUR PARTNERSHIP
WITH NVIDIA WITH MORE
INNOVATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO
DELIVER THE MOST ADVANCED
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GENERATIVE AI
WORKLOADS WITH, WITH WITH GPUS
AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE JENSEN
HUANG, FOUNDER AND CEO OF NVIDIA
HERE ON STAGE WITH US TO TELL US
MORE. KALLEL JENSEN, SO GOOD TO
SEE YOU. I'M THRILLED TO BE
HERE. YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US TODAY. IT'S
AMAZING. SO AS I'VE JUST
DISCUSSED, WE'VE GOT A LONG
PARTNERSHIP. AWS NVIDIA. I'VE
BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME
TOGETHER AND I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT HOW THE TEAMS ARE
COLLABORATING. YOU AND I WERE
TALKING ABOUT THAT BACKSTAGE.
THE COLLABORATION IS AMAZING.
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LOT OF
YEARS AND I'M JUST THRILLED TO
DEEPEN THE PARTNERSHIP. THANK
YOU. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. I'M
THRILLED TO BE HERE TO CELEBRATE
THE AMAZING WORK OF OUR TWO
TEAMS AND TO HELP ANNOUNCE OUR
BIG NEW PARTNERSHIP. YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FOR
A VERY LONG TIME. IN FACT, AWS
WAS THE WORLD'S FIRST CLOUD TO
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GPU
ACCELERATED COMPUTING. AND YOU
PUT THE WORLD'S FIRST GPUS IN
THE CLOUD A LONG TIME AGO. AND
SINCE THEN, THIS IS AN AMAZING
STATISTIC. SIX IN THE LAST
SEVERAL YEARS ALONE, JUST FOR
THE AMPERE AND HOPPER GENERATION
WE'VE PUT UP DEPLOYED BOYD TO
MILNE, XEON CPUS IN AWS THAT'S
THREE Z FLOPS. 3000 EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER HOURS MOST YEAH
EXACTLY. YEAH MOST NATIONS WILL
BE HAPPY WITH ONE EXASCALE
SUPERCOMPUTER AND AWS HAS 3000
OF THEM AND WE ARE JUST JUST
GETTING STARTED. I'M DELIGHTED
TO SEE THAT WE ARE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE TODAY A DEPLOYMENT OF A
WHOLE NEW FAMILY OF GPUS, THE L4
, THE L4 IS AND THE BRAND NEW H
200, THE H 200. THIS IS REALLY
AMAZING THING. THE COMBINATION
BETWEEN THE BRAND NEW TENSOR LLM
OPTIMIZING COMPILERS FOR
GENERATIVE AI AND H 200 IMPROVES
THE THROUGHPUT OF IN INFERENCE
LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL INFERENCE
BY A FACTOR OF FOUR REDUCING THE
COST IN JUST ONE YEAR BY A
FACTOR OF FOUR. NOW OUR
COLLABORATION STARTS WITH, OF
COURSE GREAT GPUS AND WE'RE
RAMPING SO INCREDIBLY FAST EACH
QUARTER. WE'RE STANDING UP AND
DEPLOYING MORE THAN ONE SET OF
FLOPS. MORE FOR AN AWS ONE XEN
OF FLOPS MORE EACH QUARTER. IT'S
AN UNBELIEVABLE NUMBER AND ALL
OF THIS IS, OF COURSE, MADE
POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE
ACCELERATED COMPUTING LIBRARIES.
OUR TWO TEAMS STOOD UP A WHOLE
BUNCH OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT
WE'RE ALSO BRINGING OUR MOST
POPULAR LIBRARIES, THE NVIDIA,
AI STACK, OUR NEMO LLM LARGE
LANGUAGE MODEL FRAMEWORK. THE
RETRIEVER FOR INFERENCE MODEL
FOR RAGS, OUR BIO NEMO DIGITAL
BIOLOGY, LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
FOUNDATION MODELS. ISAAC SIM ON
OMNIVERSE FOR ROBOTICS. THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT AMAZON ROBOTICS
USES TO SIMULATE ITS ROBOTS AND
ITS INCREDIBLE WAREHOUSES THAT
YOU GUYS DO. JUST ALL OF THESE
STACKS, SOFTWARE STACKS AND
LIBRARIES WE'RE GOING TO
INTEGRATE INTO AWS. SO OUR TWO
TEAMS HAVE BEEN REALLY, REALLY
BUSY. BUSY INDEED. AND THAT WAS
A LOT OF THAT WAS A LOT OF
ZETAS. AND EVERYTHING. YEAH. SO
AS YOU SAID, THE COLLABORATION
IS GOING TO ENABLE DEVELOPERS TO
ACCESS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY AND
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED IT TO
INNOVATE WITH GENERATIVE AI. NOW
THE ONE OF THE BIG
ANNOUNCEMENTS, OF COURSE, IS
THAT AWS IS GOING TO BE THE
FIRST CLOUD PROVIDER TO BRING
THE LATEST NVIDIA 200
GRACE-HOPPER SUPER CHIPS WITH A
NEW MULTI-NODE NVLINK TO THE
CLOUD FIRST PLACE. AND MAYBE YOU
CAN TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT THAT AND WHAT MAKES THAT
COMPUTING PLATFORM SO POWERFUL
AND HOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER
TO INTRODUCE IT. WELL, WE'RE
BOTH REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT ARM
PROCESSORS AND THE REASON WHY
ARM IS SO INCREDIBLE IS BECAUSE
WE CAN WE CAN MOLD IT TO EXACTLY
THE TYPE OF COMPUTING NEEDS THAT
WE HAVE. IT'S INCREDIBLY LOW
ENERGY. IT'S INCREDIBLY COST
EFFECTIVE. AND SO GRACE-HOPPER,
WHICH IS GX 200, CONNECTS TWO
REVOLUTIONARY PROCESSORS
TOGETHER IN A REALLY UNIQUE WAY.
IT CONNECTS THEM TOGETHER USING
A CHIP TO CHIP INTERCONNECT
CALLED NVLINK AT ONE TERABYTE
BYTES PER SECOND, AND IT'S
CONNECTED IN A COHERENT WAY SO
THAT THE GPU CAN ACCESS ALL OF
THE CPU'S MEMORY. THE CPU CAN
ACCESS ALL OF THE GPU'S MEMORY
AND SO THE TWO OF THESE
PROCESSORS COULD WORK HAND IN
HAND IN A REALLY FAST WAY. THE
SECOND THING THAT WE DID WAS WE
INVENTED A NEW WAY OF EXTENDING
NVLINK TO A VERY LARGE DOMAIN.
SO NOW 32 GRACE HOPPERS COULD BE
CONNECTED BY A BRAND NEW NVLINK
SWITCH, AND THAT BECOMES ONE
UNIT. AND WITH THE NITRO AWS
NITRO THAT BECOMES BASICALLY ONE
GIANT VIRTUAL GPU INSTANCE. I
MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE
THIS. YOU'VE GOT 30 2H2
HUNDREDS. INCREDIBLE HORSEPOWER
IN ONE VIRTUAL INSTANCE BECAUSE
OF AWS NITRO. AND THEN WE
CONNECT IT WITH AWS, EFA YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY FAST NETWORKING ING
ALL OF THESE UNITS NOW CAN
CREATE INTO A ULTRA CLUSTER AND
AWS GLUE CLUSTER. SO I CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE ALL THIS COME
TOGETHER. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE COMBINATION.
I MEAN, HOW CUSTOMERS ARE GOING
TO USE THIS STUFF. ONE CAN ONLY
IMAGINE AND I KNOW THAT THE TH
TWO HUNDREDS ARE REALLY GOING TO
SUPERCHARGE WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE
DOING. IT'S GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE OF COURSE, IN EC2
INSTANCES COMING SOON. NOW IN
THE WORLD OF GENERATIVE AI, A
LOT OF COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO,
UH, TO ONBOARD AI INTO THEIR
BUSINESS AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE
THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT IT
EXTENDS TO THE SOFTWARE, THE
SERVICES AND ALL OF THE OTHER
WORKFLOWS THAT THEY HAVE. SO
THIS LEADS OF COURSE, TO THE
SECOND BIG ANNOUNCEMENT WE HAVE
TODAY. SO PARTNERING NVIDIA TO
BRING THE NVIDIA DGX CLOUD TO
AWS AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE DGX
CLOUD IS IMPORTANT PLATFORM FOR
CUSTOMERS. WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
DGX CLOUD IS NVIDIA'S AI
FACTORY. THIS IS HOW OUR
RESEARCHERS ADVANCE AI. WE USE
AI TO DO NEURAL GRAPHICS. THE
WAY WE DO COMPUTER GRAPHICS
TODAY IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT AI.
WE USE AI TO ADVANCE. WE USE OUR
AI FACTORIES TO ADVANCE OUR
DIGITAL BIOLOGY MODELS, OUR
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS USE IT FOR
ROBOTICS, FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS.
WE USE IT TO SIMULATE EARTH, TO
A DIGITAL TWIN OF THE EARTH, TO
PREDICT WEATHER AND CLIMATE. IT
AND SO THE CLOUD IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO US. WE'RE
INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BUILD THE
LARGEST AI FACTORY NVIDIA HAS
EVER BUILT. WE'RE GOING TO
ANNOUNCE INSIDE OUR COMPANY WE
CALL IT PROJECT CIBA CIBA. YOU
ALL PROBABLY KNOW SINCE YOU'RE
AT A CONFERENCE IS THE LARGEST,
MOST MAGNIFICENT TREE IN THE
AMAZON. WE CALL IT PROJECT CIBA.
CIBA IS GOING TO BE 16,000 AND
16,384 GPUS CONNECTED INTO ONE
GIANT AI SUPERCOMPUTER. FOR THIS
IS UTTERLY INCREDIBLE. WE WILL
BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE TRAINING
TIME OF THE LARGEST LANGUAGE
MODELS. THE NEXT GENERATION
MOISES THESE LARGE EXTREMELY
LARGE MIXTURE MIXTURE OF
EXPERTS, MODELS AND BE ABLE TO
TRAIN IT IN JUST HALF OF THE
TIME, ESSENTIALLY REDUCE THE
COST OF TRAINING IN JUST ONE
YEAR IN HALF. NOW WE'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO TRAIN MUCH, MUCH
LARGER MULTI-MODAL MO MODELS
THIS NEXT GENERATION, LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS, THESE 16,000
GPUS WILL BE 65 EXAFLOPS. IT'S
LIKE 65 EXASCALE SUPERCOMPUTERS
IN ONE. AND SO I CAN'T WAIT FOR
US TO STAND THIS UP. OUR AI
RESEARCHERS ARE CHOMPING AT THE
BIT. NOW, OF COURSE, THIS IS
ALSO A PLACE WHERE WE
COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS AND
CUSTOMERS WHO NEED TO BUILD
CUSTOM AI MODELS. YOU KNOW, IT'S
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO USE OFF THE
SHELF MODELS AND THERE'S BE A
WHOLE BUNCH OF OFF THE SHELF
MODELS IN PUBLIC CLOUDS. IT'S
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IN A
SOFTWARE PLATFORM. COMPANIES,
SAAS COMPANIES, FOR EXAMPLE,
SALESFORCE THAT YOU MENTIONED
EARLIER, THEY'LL HAVE ALL KINDS
OF OFF THE SHELF COPILOTS AND
GENERATIVE AI MODELS. BUT A LOT
OF COMPANIES NEED TO BUILD THEIR
OWN PROPRIETARY MODELS. AND SO
WE SET UP THE AI FACTORY. SO
THAT WE COULD PARTNER WITH THEM
TO HELP THEM CREATE THEIR CUSTOM
AIS, AND NOW THEY'LL RUN ALL ON
AWS. WE'LL DEVELOP THE MODEL ON
AWS, COLLABORATE WITH OUR
CUSTOMERS ON AWS, CONNECT THEM
ALL TO YOUR SERVICES AND STORAGE
SERVICES, SECURITY SERVICES AND
ALL KINDS OF OTHER GENERATIVE AI
SERVICES AND THEN DEPLOY IT ALL
IN AWS. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO DO THIS VERY FIRST TIME
IN AWS. IT'S ALL AMAZING. I
MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING
AMAZING THINGS. WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD TO SEE US COME
TOGETHER EVEN MORE TIGHTLY. I
MEAN, IT'S JUST GOING TO BRING
INCREDIBLE BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS
WHO ARE REALLY GOING TO NEED IT.
WE APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION,
APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU AND
LOOK FORWARD TO A LOT MORE OF
THAT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU,
ADAM. THANK YOU. JENSEN. HAVE A
GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. IT'S BEEN
A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. WE REALLY
APPRECIATED IT. NOW LET'S TALK
ABOUT CAPACITY OR ACTUALLY
GETTING ACCESS TO ALL OF THAT
AMAZING COMPUTE. SO CUSTOMERS
WHO WANT TO BUILD AND TRAIN
MODELS OFTEN NEED LARGE AMOUNTS
OF RELIABLE CLUSTERED CAPACITY.
IT HAS TO BE TOGETHER OR IN
CLUSTERS, BUT THEY DON'T
NECESSARILY NEED THE SAME AMOUNT
OF IT ALL THE TIME.
FOR EXAMPLE, CUSTOMERS TRAINING A MODEL. I
MEAN, THEY MIGHT STOP TO
EVALUATE NEWS, USE NEW TRAINING
DATA OR MAKE OTHER CHANGES, AND
THEN THEY WANT TO DO MORE
TRAINING. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS
THAT THEY OFTEN NEED SHORT TERM
CLUSTERED CAPACITY AND IT'S
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NO ONE, NO
CLOUD HAS BEEN ADDRESSING UNTIL
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
FOR ML AND EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
WERE THE FIRST CONSUMPTION MODEL
IN THE INDUSTRY THAT ENABLES ANY
CUSTOMER TO RESERVE THE HIGHLY
SOUGHT AFTER GPU CAPACITY TO RUN
FOR SHORT DURATION MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS. AND THIS
ELIMINATES THE NEED TO HOLD ON
TO THE CAPACITY HOLDING CAPACITY
THAT THEY'RE USING JUST SO THEY
CAN BE CERTAIN THAT THEY CAN USE
IT LATER IF THEY NEED TO USE IT
LATER. NOW EC2 CAPACITY BLOCKS
ARE DEPLOYED IN ULTRACLUSTERS
INTERCONNECTED WITH OUR EFA
NETWORKING THAT WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THIS MORNING AND THAT
ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO SCALE UP TO
HUNDREDS OF GPUS IN A SINGLE
CLUSTER WITH THIS NEW OFFERING.
SO WITH THE CAPACITY BLOCKS,
CUSTOMERS CAN PLAN FOR THEIR ML
WORKLOAD DEPLOYMENTS WITH
CERTAINTY AND THEY KNOW THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE GPU
CAPACITY WHEN THEY NEED IT AND
ONLY WHEN THEY NEED IT. NOW
SUPPORT FOR THE LATEST
GENERATION. HIGH PERFORMANCE
GPUS COMBINED WITH OUR
INNOVATIONS, VIRTUALIZATION,
NETWORKING, CLUSTER MANAGEMENT.
THESE ARE REASONS WHY AWS IS THE
BEST PLACE TO RUN GPUS IN THE
WORLD, BUT TO DRIVE INNOVATION
AND THE BROAD CHOICES THAT OUR
CUSTOMERS WANT IN ML AND AI, WE
REALIZED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT
AGAIN HERE IS ANOTHER PLACE WE'D
HAVE TO INNOVATE ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO THE SILICON, JUST LIKE
WE DID WITH GRAVITON FOR GENERAL
PURPOSE COMPUTING AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT TRAINIUM AND INFERENTIA
. SO TRAINIUM IS OUR PURPOSE
BUILT CHIP FOR TRAINING, MACHINE
LEARNING WORKLOADS, MACHINE
LEARNING MODELS AND INFERENTIA
IS OUR CHIP OPTIMIZED FOR
RUNNING INFERENCE ON THOSE
MODELS? SO EARLIER THIS YEAR WE
ALREADY ANNOUNCED THE SECOND
GENERATION OF OUR INFERENTIA
CHIP INFERENTIA TO AND BECAUSE
WE OPTIMIZE FOR INFERENCE, THE
TWO INSTANCES POWERED BY
INFERENTIA TO ARE OFFER THE BEST
LOWEST COST INFERENCE IN EC2
WHILE ALSO DELIVERING UP TO FOUR
TIMES HIGHER THROUGHPUT AND TEN
TIMES LOWER LATENCY COMPARED TO
THE INF1 INSTANCES. CUSTOMERS
LIKE ADOBE, DEUTSCHE TELEKOM,
LEONARDO, AI, THEY'VE ALL SEEN
GREAT EARLY RESULTS AND THEY ARE
DEPLOYING THEIR GENERATIVE AI AI
MODELS AT SCALE WITH INFERENTIA
TO. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF
INTEREST IN TRAINIUM AS WELL.
OUR TRN1 INSTANCES POWERED BY
TRAINIUM HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED BY A
LOT OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
ANTHROPIC PARTNERS LIKE
DATABRICKS AND RICOH AND OUR OWN
AMAZON SEARCH TEAM USES TRN1
INSTANCES TO TRAIN TRAIN A
LARGE, DEEP, LARGE SCALE, DEEP
LEARNING MODELS. THEY'RE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF A TRAINIUM HIGH
PERFORMANCE SCALE RELIABILITY
AND LOW COST. BUT AS CUSTOMERS
CONTINUE TO TRAIN BIGGER AND
BIGGER MODELS ON LARGER AND
LARGER DATA SETS, WE REALIZED WE
NEEDED TO KEEP PUSHING AND
PUSHING OUR PRICE PERFORMANCE.
WE'RE NEVER DONE THERE. AND
TODAY I'M REALLY EXCITED TO
ANNOUNCE AWS TRAINIUM TO OUR
SECOND GENERATION. IT'S OUR
SECOND GENERATION CHIP. THAT'S
PURPOSE BUILT FOR HIGH
PERFORMANCE TRAINING OF
FOUNDATION MODELS, TRAINING IS
DESIGNED TO DELIVER UP TO FOUR
TIMES FASTER PERFORMANCE
COMPARED TO OUR FIRST GENERATION
CHIPS AND THAT MAKES IT IDEAL
FOR TRAINING FOUNDATION MODELS
WITH HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OR
EVEN TRILLIONS OF PARAMETERS.
TRAINIUM TWO IS GOING TO POWER
THE NEXT GENERATION OF EC2
ULTRACLUSTERS AND WILL DELIVER
UP TO 65 EXAFLOPS OF AGGREGATE
COMPUTE AND WE EXPECT THE FIRST
TRAINIUM TWO BASED INSTANCES ARE
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR
AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO DO
WITH THEM. MEANWHILE ALL A LOT
OF OTHER CLOUD PROVIDERS ARE
STILL JUST TALKING ABOUT THEIR
OWN. ML CHIPS. WE'VE ALSO MADE A
LOT OF EXCITING PROGRESS IN
BUILDING THE SOFTWARE TOOLCHAIN
THAT SUPPORTS TRAINIUM IN
INFERENTIA. SO AWS NEURON IS OUR
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT THAT
HELPS CUSTOMERS GET MAXIMUM
PERFORMANCE FROM ML CHIPS. NEW
RON SUPPORTS MACHINE LEARNING
FRAMEWORKS LIKE TENSORFLOW
PYTORCH WITH JAX SUPPORT COMING
REALLY SOON AND SO CUSTOMERS CAN
USE THEIR EXISTING KNOWLEDGE TO
BUILD TRAINING AND INFERENCE
PIPELINES WITH JUST A FEW LINES
OF CODE AND NEURON SUPPORTS THE
MOST POPULAR MODELS, INCLUDING
93 OF THE TOP 100 AND COUNTING.
IMPORTANTLY, YOU ALSO NEED THE
RIGHT TOOLS TO HELP TRAIN AND
DEPLOY YOUR MODELS AND THIS IS
WHY WE HAVE AMAZON SAGEMAKER OUR
MANAGED SERVICE. THAT MAKES IT
EASY FOR DEVELOPERS TO TRAIN,
TUNE, BUILD, MANAGE MACHINE
LEARNING AND FOUNDATION MODELS.
IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE WE
LAUNCHED SAGEMAKER, WE'VE
INTRODUCED A LOT OF POWERFUL
INNOVATIONS LIKE AUTOML MODEL
TUNING, DISTRIBUTED TRAINING,
FLEXIBLE MODEL DEPLOYMENT TOOLS
FOR ML OPS AND BUILT IN FEATURES
LIKE RESPONSIBLE AI. SAGEMAKER
HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN
DEMOCRATIZING ML FOR TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING STABILITY AI AI21LABS
LABS, THOMSON REUTERS,
ASTRAZENECA, 3M, HEALTH
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AWS,
FERRARI AND MORE, AND SAGEMAKER
CAN TRAIN MODELS WITH UP TO
BILLIONS OF PARAMETERS FOR
EXAMPLE, TI HAS TRAINED 180
BILLION PARAMETER FALCON FM,
WHICH IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MODEL ON
SAGEMAKER USING 3000 GPUS AND
PETABYTES OF PETABYTES OF DATA
STORED IN S3. AND YOU CAN ALSO
DEPLOY THIS TOP RANKED MODEL
USING SAGEMAKER. WE'VE ALSO BEEN
WORKING CLOSELY WITH HUGGINGFACE
TO SUPPORT THEIR MODELS ON
SAGEMAKER AND HAVE COLLABORATED
TO CREATE THE HUGGING FACE DEEP
LEARNING CONTAINERS TO HELP
ACCELERATE TRAINING AND
DEPLOYMENT OF FMS USING
SAGEMAKER, TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA. SO IF YOU'RE
BUILDING YOUR OWN MODELS. AWS IS
RELENTLESSLY FOCUSED ON
EVERYTHING YOU NEED THE BEST
CHIPS, THE MOST ADVANCED
VIRTUALIZATION, POWERFUL
PETABYTE SCALE NETWORKING
CAPABILITIES, HYPER SCALE
CLUSTERING AND THE RIGHT TOOLS
TO HELP YOU BUILD. BUT OF
COURSE, AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF
ORGANIZATIONS JUST WANT TO BE
ABLE TO ACCESS THE MOST POWERFUL
MODELS OUT THERE. THEY WANT TO
GET STARTED QUICKLY,
EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT FMS
AND TESTING DIFFERENT USE CASES
AND TO MEET THE ENORMOUS
OPPORTUNITY HEAD ON. BUT THEY
ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS LIKE WHICH
MODEL SHOULD I EVEN USE AND HOW
DO I DECIDE WHICH ARE BEST FOR
MY APPLICATION? TITAN HOW CAN I
MOVE QUICKLY TO BUILD AND DEPLOY
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS? JENS
AND HOW CAN I KEEP MY DATA
SECURE AND PRIVATE? THAT'S WHY
WE'RE INVESTING IN THAT MIDDLE
LAYER OF THE STACK. SO NOW WE
KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU NEED IT TO
BE EASIER TO ACCESS A POWERFUL
AND DIVERSE SET OF MODELS. LMS
OTHER FOUNDATION MODELS, AND
THEN TO QUICKLY BUILD
APPLICATIONS WITH THEM ALL THE
TIME, MAINTAINING YOUR SECURITY
AND PRIVACY AND THAT'S WHY WE
BUILT AMAZON BEDROCK SO BEDROCK
IS THE EASIEST WAY TO BUILD AND
SCALE GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS
FOR LMS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS AND CUSTOMERS IN EVERY
INDUSTRY ARE ALREADY USING
BEDROCK TO REINVENT THEIR USER
EXPERIENCES, THEIR PRODUCTS AND
THEIR PROCESSES, AND TO BRING AI
INTO THE HEART OF THEIR
BUSINESSES. SO WHY BEDROCK? SO
FIRST, YOU ENJOY THE BROADEST
CHOICE OF MODELS, MANY OF WHICH
ARE AVAILABLE FIRST OR IN SOME
CASES ONLY ON BEDROCK YOU CAN
ADD YOUR OWN BUSINESS CONTEXT
QUICKLY, EASILY AND PRIVATELY
WITH THE BROADEST SELECTION OF
CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS AND YOU
GET ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
AND PRIVACY. BECAUSE WE DESIGNED
IT THAT WAY FROM DAY ONE. AND
THE CUSTOMER EXCITEMENT HAS BEEN
OVERWHELMING. WE MADE THE
SERVICE GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN
SEPTEMBER AND NOW OVER 10,000
CUSTOMERS ARE USING BEDROCK
AROUND THE WORLD ACROSS
VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY, ADIDAS
HAS ENABLING DEVELOPERS TO GET
QUICK, ACCURATE ANSWERS TO DEEP
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, AS CARRIER
IS USING BEDROCK TO COMBINE
HISTORICAL ACTIONS, PREDICTIVE
ANALYTICS SYSTEMS, ALERTS AND
DATA TRENDS TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THESE ARE
HELPING CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR
ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CUT
CARBON EMISSIONS. NASDAQ IS
USING BEDROCK TO AUTOMATE
INVESTIGATIVE WORKFLOWS ON
SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS AND TO
STRENGTHEN THEIR ANTI ANTI
FINANCIAL CRIME AND SURVEILLANCE
CAPABILITIES. SO MANY MORE,
INCLUDING BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES, CLARIANT COX
AUTOMOTIVE, GODADDY. LEXISNEXIS.
MERCK OMNICOM GROUP ARE ALL
USING BEDROCK. THEY'RE ALL USING
IT TO BUILD GENAI APPLICATIONS.
TODAY BUT IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS.
EVERY ONE IS MOVING FAST,
EXPERIMENTING AND LEARNING. AND
AT THE SAME TIME, THE GENERATIVE
AI TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IS EVOLVING
QUICKLY WITH NEW DEVELOPMENTS
PRACTICALLY EVERY DAY AND
CUSTOMERS ARE FINDING THAT
DIFFERENT MODELS ACTUALLY WORK
BETTER FOR DIFFERENT USE CASES
OR ON DIFFERENT SETS OF DATA.
SOME MODELS ARE GREAT FOR
SUMMARIZATION, OTHERS ARE GOOD
FOR REASONING AND INTEGRATION,
AND STILL OTHERS HAVE AWESOME
LANGUAGE SUPPORT. AND THEN
THERE'S IMAGE GENERATION IN
SEARCH USE CASES AND MORE, ALL
COMING FROM BOTH PROPRIETARY
MODELS AND MODELS THAT ARE
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY.
I MEAN, THINGS ARE MOVING SO
FAST AND IN THAT TYPE OF
ENVIRONMENT THAT THE ABILITY TO
ADAPT IS THE MOST VALUABLE
CAPABILITY THAT YOU CAN HAVE.
THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE
MODEL TO RULE THEM ALL, AND
THERE'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE ONE COMPANY PROVIDING THE
MODELS THAT EVERYBODY USES. SO
YOU DON'T WANT A CLOUD PROVIDER
WHO'S BEHOLDEN PRIMARILY TO ONE
MODEL PROVIDER. YOU NEED TO BE
TRYING OUT DIFFERENT MODELS. YOU
NEED TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH
BETWEEN THEM RAPIDLY OR EVEN
COMBINING THEM WITH THE SAME USE
CASES. AND YOU NEED A REAL
CHOICE OF MODEL PROVIDERS AS YOU
DECIDE WHO'S GOT THE BEST
TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO WHO HAS THE
DEPENDABILITY THAT YOU NEED IN A
BUSINESS PARTNER. I THINK THE
EVENTS OF THE PAST TEN DAYS HAVE
MADE THAT VERY CLEAR. WE'VE BEEN
CONSISTENT ABOUT THIS NEED FOR
CHOICE FOR THE WHOLE HISTORY OF
AWS, AND THAT'S THE APPROACH
THAT WE CLEARLY LAID OUT WHEN WE
STARTED TALKING ABOUT OUR
GENERATIVE AI STRATEGY ALMOST A
YEAR AGO. AND THAT'S WHY WE
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE, TO MAKE
BUILDING AND MOVING BETWEEN A
RANGE OF FOUNDATION MODELS AS
EASY AS AN API CALL. TODAY
BEDROCK PROVIDES ACCESS TO A
WIDE RANGE OF MODELS FROM
LEADERS LIKE I. 21 ANTHROPIC
COHERE STABILITY AI, AS WELL AS
AMAZON'S OWN AMAZON TITAN MODELS
. BUT WE DIDN'T STOP THERE. WE
WERE THE FIRST TO MAKE METIS
LLAMA 2 MODEL AVAILABLE THROUGH
A FULLY MANAGED API. AND WE ALSO
RECENTLY ANNOUNCED OUR EXPANDED
COLLABORATION WITH ANTHROPIC. SO
ANTHROPIC IS A LONG TIME AWS
CUSTOMER AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S
LEADING FOUNDATION MODEL
PROVIDERS. THEIR MODELS CLAUDE
AND THEY GOT OTHERS AS WELL
EXCEL AT A WIDE RANGE OF TASKS
FROM SOPHISTICATED DIALOG AND
CREATIVE CONTENT GENERATION TO
COMPLEX REASONING AND DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS. SO AS PART OF THE
COLLABORATION, ANTHROPIC IS
GOING TO USE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA TO TRAIN FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF THEIR MODELS AND
BEDROCK CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO
HAVE EARLY ACCESS, NOT AVAILABLE
ON OTHER CLOUDS TO UNIQUE
FEATURES FOR MODEL CUSTOMIZATION
AND FINE TUNING CAPABILITIES. SO
TO DIG IN ON WHAT WE'RE DOING
WITH ANTHROPIC, I'D LIKE TO
BRING OUT OUR PARTNER DARIO
OMODEI, WHO'S THE CEO AND
CO-FOUNDER OF ANTHROPIC. LET'S
GIVE HIM A HAND. AS WELL. ALL
RIGHT. WE HAVE CHAIRS. LET'S SIT
. DARIO THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. YEAH.
EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
CLAUDE IS AVAILABLE ON BEDROCK,
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT,
LET'S JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS ABOUT
AND WHAT MAKES CLAUDE SO UNIQUE.
YES SO ANTHROPIC WAS FOUNDED ON
THE IDEA THAT WE CAN MAKE AI
MODELS THAT ARE SAFE, RELIABLE
AND STEERABLE WHILE STILL BEING
HIGHLY CAPABLE. THE FOUNDERS OF
ANTHROPIC WERE A SET OF PEOPLE
WHO WORKED AT OPENAI FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. WE DEVELOPED IDEAS LIKE
GPT THREE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK, SCALING
LAWS FOR LANGUAGE MODELS. SOME
OF THE KEY IDEAS BEHIND THE
CURRENT GENERATIVE AI BOOM.
SEVEN OF US LEFT AND FOUNDED
ANTHROPIC, OUR FOUNDATION MODEL
CLAUDE. IN ADDITION TO BEING
SAFE AND RELIABLE, EXCELS AT A
LOT OF KNOWLEDGE WORK TASKS LIKE
CONTENT, GENERATION,
SUMMARIZATION, Q&A, COMPLEX
REASONING, THINGS LIKE THAT. WE
HAVE AN INDUSTRY LEADING CONTEXT
WINDOW OF 200 K TOKENS. THAT'S
ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH MAKES
IT WELL SUITED FOR AREAS LIKE
LEGAL FINANCE, INSURANCE,
CODING, THINGS LIKE THAT. AND
ABOUT HALF OF THE FORTUNE 500
ARE USING OR ARE TESTING CLAUDE.
SO AMAZING PROGRESS. SO JUST A
FEW MONTHS AGO, OBVIOUSLY AMAZON
AND ANTHROPIC ANNOUNCED KIND OF
AN ENHANCED STRATEGIC
COLLABORATION ANTHROPIC NAMED
AWS IS YOUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO
BE TRAINING AND DEPLOYING FUTURE
GENERATIONS OF CLAUDE AND
FOUNDATION MODELS ON AWS. SO
JUST TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT LED
UP TO THIS AND HOW THAT
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANTHROPIC
AND AWS GROW? YEAH. SO ANTHROPIC
USE OF AWS GOES BACK TO OUR
EARLY HISTORY BACK ALL THE WAY
IN THE MIDST OF TIME IN 2021. WE
CAN REMEMBER THAT, RIGHT? WE
TRAINED OUR FIRST. WE TRAINED
OUR FIRST MODEL ON AWS. AND SO
WE'RE EXCITED NOW TO SAY THAT
YOU GUYS ARE OUR PRIMARY CLOUD
PROVIDER FOR MISSION CRITICAL
WORKLOADS. I WOULD SAY THE
PARTNERSHIP HAS THREE
COMPONENTS. FIRST IS THE COMPUTE
SIDE, WHICH I JUST DISCUSSED,
WHICH WE'VE BEEN DOING
THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT OUR
HISTORY. THE SECOND IS ON THE
PROVISION TO CUSTOMER SIDE.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT
AMAZON BEDROCK WE REALLY
RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THAT WE
COULD PROVIDE TO CUSTOMERS
WORKING TOGETHER AND THE THIRD
SIDE IS THE HARDWARE. WE'RE
CURRENTLY WORKING WITH YOU GUYS
TO OPTIMIZE THESE TRAINIUM AND
INFERENTIA FOR OUR USE CASES AND
HOPEFULLY FOR OTHER USE CASES.
AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE
CAN ACHIEVE THAT FOREX FASTER
THAN THE FIRST GENERATION
TRAINIUM THAT YOU JUST
ANNOUNCED. IF WE OPTIMIZE THESE
THINGS TOGETHER. AND SO PUTTING
TOGETHER THESE THREE PIECES,
LAYERS OF THE STACK REALLY
ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE THINGS TO
CUSTOMERS TOGETHER THAT COULDN'T
BE PROVIDED BEFORE THINGS LIKE
CUSTOMIZATION OF MODELS USE OF
PROPRIETARY DATA AND UNIQUE FINE
TUNING FEATURES. WELL, IT'S THE
RESPECT WE HAVE FOR YOU GUYS IS
JUST TREMENDOUS. I MEAN, TRULY
WORLD CLASS EXPERTISE FOR THE
ANTHROPIC TEAM. I'VE REALLY
ENJOYED WORKING TOGETHER AND THE
MODELS ARE JUST SO POWERFUL. SO
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE AIMING TO AND I
THINK WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
IMPROVING AN INCREDIBLE ARRAY OF
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES THROUGH
THIS COLLABORATION. TITAN AND OF
COURSE OUR OWN AMAZON DEVELOPERS
ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO ANTHROPIC
MODELS ON BEDROCK AND THROUGHOUT
THE COMPANY. AND WE'RE NOT ONLY
WORKING TO PROVIDE HOOD
CUSTOMERS WITH, WITH, WITH THIS,
BUT WE'RE GIVING THEM EARLY
ACCESS TO UNIQUE FEATURES THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
GET ANYWHERE ELSE. AND WE'RE OUT
THERE TOGETHER WITH OUR
GENERATIVE AI INNOVATION CENTER,
WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE
FIELD, HELPING THEM TO ACTUALLY
GET GET TARGETED. AND THAT'S
ALLOWING US, OF COURSE, TO BRING
THIS EXPERTISE AND THE DOMAIN
SPECIFIC EXPERTISE THAT THEY
NEED TO CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS.
AND AS WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE
TOGETHER AND IT'S BEEN HOT AND
HEAVY, PARTICULARLY THE PAST FEW
WEEKS, BUT BEFORE THAT AS WELL,
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST
INTERESTING USE CASES THAT
YOU'VE SEEN? YEAH SO I'LL GIVE
THREE EXAMPLES ACROSS DIFFERENT
INDUSTRIES. THERE'S MANY OTHERS,
BUT THIS SHOULD GIVE GIVE A
SENSE OF THE RANGE. AND WE WE'VE
SEEN A LOT OF ORGANIC ADOPTION.
ONE EXAMPLE IN THE BIOMEDICAL
SPACE WE'RE HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE
WE'RE WORKING WITH PFIZER. I'M A
FORMER BIOLOGIST MYSELF, SO I'M
REALLY EXCITED FOR ANY WAY I CAN
CAN ADVANCE MEDICAL SCIENCE AND
BRING BRING LIFE SAVING DRUGS TO
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND THE
LEGAL SPACE. WE MADE A CUSTOM
FINE TUNED MODEL, DEPLOYED IT TO
YOU GUYS FOR LEXISNEXIS TO HELP
WITH THEIR LEGAL SEARCH. YOU
KNOW, IN A WAY THAT'S KIND OF
FACT BASED AND PRODUCE CITATIONS
. AND IN THE FINANCE SPACE,
WE'RE WORKING WITH BRIDGEWATER
ASSOCIATES TO DEVELOP AN
INVESTMENT ANALYST, ASSISTANT.
BUT BEYOND THAT, JUST SOME
EXAMPLES. WE'VE ENGAGED WITH
SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF SOME OF THE
LARGEST PLAYERS IN THE INSURANCE
AND BANKING INDUSTRIES AND, YOU
KNOW, COULD TELL SIMILAR STORIES
ABOUT OTHER INDUSTRIES. SO, YOU
KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE
NEW USE CASES AND WHERE ALL OF
THIS GOES. THAT'S INCREDIBLE
MOMENTUM. JUST THE FINANCIAL
SERVICES EXAMPLE TO BE WORKING
WITH WITH THAT MANY LEADERS. SO
JUST LAST WEEK YOU'RE NOT
STANDING STILL, RIGHT. SO JUST
LAST WEEK YOU ANNOUNCED CLAUDE
2.1. SO THAT'S GOT A WHOLE LOT
OF NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN KEY
CAPABLE CITIES. MAYBE YOU CAN
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.
YEAH. SO CLAUDE 2.1 REALLY IS A
RELEASE THAT'S TARGETED AT
ENTERPRISES. SO A FEW DIFFERENT
FEATURES. ONE IS WE'VE DOUBLED
OUR CONTEXT WINDOW TO 200,000
TOKENS. TOKENS IS A TERM OF ART
IN THE AI SPACE. WHAT IT AMOUNTS
TO IS ABOUT 150,000 WORDS, WHICH
IS A RELATIVELY LONG BOOK. AND
SO USE CASES LIKE READING
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, READING AN
ENTIRE LONG BOOK. AND ONE OF MY
FAVORITES, PUTTING MULTIPLE
DOCUMENTS IN THE CONTEXT WINDOW
AND ASKING THE MODEL TO COMPARE
THEM OR INTEGRATE THEM. A SECOND
FEATURE IS THAT WE'VE REDUCED
THE RATE OF SO-CALLED
HALLUCINATIONS, WHICH IS WHEN
MODELS SAY THINGS THAT AREN'T
TRUE TO BY BY ABOUT TWO X WE'VE
SEEN ACROSS THE INDUSTRY A CORE
OBSTACLE TO DEPLOYMENT IN THE
ENTERPRISE WORLD IS PEOPLE ARE
WORRIED THAT MODELS WILL SAY
THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE. NO ONE
HAS PERFECTLY SOLVED THIS
PROBLEM, BUT WE ARE REALLY
LEADING THE WAY IN GETTING MORE
AND MORE REDUCTIONS AND THEN WE
ALSO HAVE SOME BETA FEATURES AS
WE'RE INTRODUCING SYSTEM PROMPTS
FOR TOOL USE AS A BETA FEATURE
AND A DEVELOPER WORKBENCH.
AGAIN, ALL TOOLS TARGETED AT
PEOPLE BUILDING FOR ENTERPRISES.
WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE ALL THE USE
CASES THAT EMERGE FROM THIS. I'M
SPEECHLESS. YES, THAT IS SUCH
INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. YES. I
MEAN, YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU
TALKED ABOUT THE REDUCTION OF
HALLUCINATION, A REALLY
IMPORTANT TOPIC. YOU JUST MORE
BROADLY, I THINK WE SHARE A
BELIEF THAT I SHOULD BE SAFE,
SECURE, RESPONSIBLE AND BENEFIT
SOCIETY. AND WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED
A LOT OF GROUPS AND
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROMOTING
THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT
OF RESPONSIBLE AI IN FACT, I
KEEP BUMPING INTO DARIA AROUND
THE WORLD AT SOME OF THESE
VARIOUS GATHERINGS, WHICH IS
NICE. SO I KNOW THIS IS A
PARTICULAR PASSION OF YOURS. AND
CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT ANTHROPIC WORK IN
THIS AREA? YEAH I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING WE
WERE FOUNDED ON AND THAT WE CARE
ABOUT DEEPLY. WE I WOULD
CATEGORIZE IT INTO TWO AREAS
WHERE WE'VE DONE WORK IN THIS
AREA. ONE IS THE WAY WE DESIGN
OUR OWN MODELS AND THE OTHER IS
THE WAY THAT WE TRY TO SET AN
EXAMPLE FOR THE ECOSYSTEM AND
BRING OTHERS ALONG SO THAT
ULTIMATELY EVERYONE BECOMES
SAFER AND MORE RELIABLE. SO
LARGE FRACTION ON THE FIRST ONE,
A LARGE FRACTION OF OUR RESEARCH
ORG WORKS ON SAFETY. WE PUT A
LOT OF WORK INTO MAKING OUR
MODELS HARD TO BREAK, MAKING
THEM SECURE AGAINST MISUSE AND
HARMFUL USE. THERE WAS A RECENT
STUDY OUT OF CARNEGIE MELLON
WHERE PEOPLE TRIED TO
ADVERSARIALLY BREAK DIFFERENT
MODELS AND IT FOUND THAT THEY
WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY BREAK
CLAUDE TEN TIMES LESS OFTEN THAN
THEY WERE ABLE TO BREAK THE
COMPETITOR'S MODEL. SO THERE'S A
REAL DIFFERENCE HERE. A SECOND
WE'VE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO
INTERPRETABILITY SEEING INSIDE
THE MODELS. THERE'S NO
COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENTS ON THAT
SO FAR. BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG ARC
AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT RELATIVELY
SOON FOR BOTH COMPLIANCE AND FOR
UNDERSTANDING WHAT MODELS DO AND
THEREFORE REDUCING BAD BEHAVIOR
FROM THE MODELS, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE
WIDER ECOSYSTEM. YOU KNOW, WE
ALWAYS TRY TO CREATE A RACE TO
THE TOP, DO SOMETHING, AND THEN
COMPETITORS, OTHER PLAYERS IN
THE ECOSYSTEM, FOLLOW ALONG AND
DO THE SAME THING. AN EXAMPLE OF
THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE SCALING
POLICY WHERE WE FRONT LOADED
SAFETY INVESTMENT AHEAD OF MODEL
SCALING, A KIND OF
PRE-DEPLOYMENT TESTING REGIME
LIKE WHAT'S DONE FOR CARS AND
AIRPLANES. AND IN THE POLICY
SPACE, WE'VE CONTINUALLY
ADVOCATED FOR GOVERNMENTS TO
BUILD UP THEIR ABILITY TO
EVALUATE AND MEASURE AI SYSTEMS
AS IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO EVALUATE
AND MEASURE THINGS, WE'LL GET
EITHER NO REGULATION OR POORLY
INFORMED REGULATION. WE NEED TO
ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE CAN DEVELOP QUICKLY,
RESPONSIBLY, BUT IN A WAY THAT'S
SECURE. I JUST LOVE THE CONCEPT
OF THE RACE TO THE TOP. IT'S SO
POSITIVE. AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS SO AMAZING. I MEAN, WE'VE
SAID IT THE WHOLE 17 YEARS THAT
AWS HAS BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES
THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT GIVES US
ENERGY IS JUST WORKING WITH THE
COOLEST, MOST CUTTING EDGE, YOU
KNOW, STARTUPS AND ENTREPRENEURS
IN THE WORLD. AND THERE IS JUST
NO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN GENERATIVE AI NOW.
AND WHAT WHAT ANTHROPIC IS
DOING. SO IT'S GREAT TO BE
PARTNERING TOGETHER SO DEEPLY
AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
JOINING ME HERE ON STAGE TODAY.
YEAH, EXCITED FOR EVERYTHING WE
CAN DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU. ALL
RIGHT.
ALL RIGHTY. SO THAT'S AMAZING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN, DARIA,
FOR COMING OUT AND JOINING US.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. SO THE
INNOVATION AROUND GENERATIVE AI
MODELS IS EXPLOSIVE AND WE
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
WITH ALL OF OUR BEDROCK PARTNERS
FOR YEARS TO COME. INCREDIBLY
INNOVATIVE SPACE. AND WE'RE ALSO
EXCITED ABOUT THE LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS AND OTHER FOUNDATION
MODELS THAT WE'RE BUILDING
OURSELVES AT AMAZON SO OUR
AMAZON TITAN MODELS WERE CREATED
AND PRE-TRAINED BY AWS, AND
WE'RE BUILDING OUR OWN MODELS IN
ORDER TO BRING ACTUALLY A FEW
BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS. SO WE DO
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE HERE. I
MEAN, AMAZON HAS BEEN WORKING ON
AI FOR 25 YEARS. I'VE GOT A LONG
TRACK RECORD. WE USE THE
TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR BUSINESS
AND WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
BUILDING AND DEPLOYING MODELS.
AND AS A RESULT, WE CAN PROVIDE
A WHOLE RANGE OF MODELS THAT
OFFER REALLY POWERFUL
CAPABILITIES AND ALSO GREAT
ECONOMICS TO SUPPORT A WHOLE
BUNCH OF USE CASES AND WE
CAREFULLY CHOOSE HOW WE TRAIN
OUR MODELS AND THE DATA THAT WE
USE TO DO SO. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY
GOING TO INDEMNIFY CUSTOMERS
AGAINST CLAIMS THAT OUR MODELS
OR THEIR OUTPUTS INFRINGE ON
ANYBODY'S COPYRIGHT. NOW, THERE
ARE ALREADY MULTIPLE MODELS IN
THE TITAN FAMILY. WE'VE GOT
TITAN TEXT LITE, WHICH IS IDEAL
FOR TEXT BASED TASKS LIKE
SUMMARIZATION. WE'VE ALSO GOT
TITAN TEXT EXPRESS, WHICH IS
GREAT FOR MORE ADVANCED GENERAL
LANGUAGE TASKS LIKE COPY
EDITING, COPYWRITING AND WE'VE
ALSO GOT THE TITAN TEXT
EMBEDDINGS MODEL FOR SEARCH USE
CASES OR PERSONALIZATION AND
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ADDING
MODELS TO THE TITAN FAMILY. AND
IF YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT, THEN
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TUNE INTO
SWAMI'S KEYNOTE TOMORROW. A
LITTLE, LITTLE WORD UP NOW, ALL
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS THAT
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE
ALL EXTREMELY CAPABLE AND THEY
ALL ENABLE A LOT OF GREAT
APPLICATIONS. BUT TO REALLY
DRIVE YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED
GENERATIVE AI THAT UNDERSTANDS
YOUR BUSINESS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
CUSTOMERS, UNDERSTANDS YOUR
PRODUCTS, YOUR OPERATIONS. AND
THAT'S ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN YOU
USE YOUR OWN DATA TO IMPROVE AND
CUSTOMIZE THE MODELS. THE MODELS
HAVE TO BECOME UNIQUE TO YOU. SO
AMAZON BEDROCK IS GIVING YOU ALL
OF THE PURPOSE BUILT
CAPABILITIES THAT YOU NEED TO
CUSTOMIZE THE AI APPLICATIONS
WITH YOUR OWN DATA. SO WITH A
FEW CLICKS YOU CAN GO FROM
GENERIC APPLICATIONS TO ONES
THAT ARE HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND
HIGHLY TAILORED. SO ONE
IMPORTANT TECHNIQUE IS CALLED
FINE TUNING. NOW, WITH FINE
TUNING, YOU POINT THE MODELS TO
EXAMPLES OF DATA IN S3 THAT
YOU'VE LABELED LABELED TO
PROVIDE CONTEXT. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU MIGHT POINT TO PROPOSALS AND
YOU'VE LABELED SOME OF THOSE
PROPOSALS AS STRONG. SO IN THIS
WAY THE MODEL LEARNS FROM YOU,
LEARNS FROM YOUR DATA. WHAT
MATTERS THE MOST TO YOU. AND
THEN BEDROCK MAKES A COPY OF THE
BASE MODELS. IT TRAINS IT, IT
CREATES A PRIVATE FINE TUNED
MODEL SO YOU GET TAILORED
RESPONSES. SO FINE TUNING IS
AVAILABLE IN AMAZON TITAN TEXT
LITE AND EXPRESS, AND TODAY IT'S
ALSO GENERALLY AVAILABLE FOR
COHERE COMMAND LITE AND META
LLAMA 2 AND FINE TUNING IS
COMING TO ANTHROPIC CLAUDE SOON.
SO A SECOND TECHNIQUE FOR
TAILORING TAILORING FOUNDATION
MODELS FOR YOUR BUSINESS IS
CALLED RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED
GENERATION OR RAG ANOTHER ONE OF
THE TERMS YOU SEE OUT THERE A
LOT. SO RAG ALLOWS YOU TO
CUSTOMIZE A MODEL'S RESPONSES
WHEN YOU WANT THE MODEL TO
CONSIDER NEW KNOWLEDGE OR UP TO
DATE INFORMATION. SO BEDROCK
DOES THIS FOR YOU BY CALLING AND
BRINGING BACK YOUR OWN DATA,
YOUR DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES,
INCLUDING DOCUMENT REPOSITORIES,
DATABASES AND OTHER APIS AND
MORE SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MODEL
MIGHT USE RAG TO RETRIEVE SEARCH
RESULTS FROM OUR AMAZON
OPENSEARCH SERVICE OR DOCUMENTS
FROM S3. AND IN SEPTEMBER, WE
INTRODUCED A RAG CAPABILITY
CALLED KNOWLEDGE BASES THAT
CONNECTS FM TO YOUR PROPRIETARY
DATA SOURCES TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR
PROMPTS WITH MORE INFORMATION
AND TODAY KNOWLEDGE BASES IS
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. NOW, A
THIRD WAY THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE
MODELS INSIDE OF BEDROCK IS A
TECHNIQUE CALLED CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING. SO CONTINUED
PRE-TRAINING IS A TECHNIQUE THAT
USES LARGE AMOUNTS OF UNLABELED
DATA BEFORE YOU FINE TUNE IT.
YOU DID THE LABELED DATA HERE IS
UNLABELED DATA LIKE THE RAW TEXT
OF INTERNAL REPORTS, FINANCIAL
PLANS OR RESEARCH RESULTS THAT
YOU HAVE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE
USED TO IMPROVE THE MODELS,
KNOWLEDGE AND ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES USING THINGS IN
YOUR OWN SPECIFIC DOMAIN. SO
CONTINUED PRE-TRAINING IS OF
COURSE AVAILABLE IN BEDROCK
TODAY. NOW ALL OF THESE
TECHNIQUES, THEY'RE ALL POWERFUL
TOOLS IN MAKING GENERATIVE AI
TARGETED, MAKING IT TRULY USEFUL
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND BEDROCK
MAKES IT REALLY EASY TO COMBINE
THESE TECHNIQUES TOGETHER. SO A
GREAT EXAMPLE OF A CUSTOMER
USING BEDROCK TO CUSTOMIZE THEIR
GENERATIVE AI AI APPLICATIONS IS
DELTA AIRLINES. SO DELTA IS
ACTUALLY MODERNIZING ITS
CUSTOMER SERVICE CAPABILITY WITH
GENERATIVE AI AI BUILT ON AMAZON
BEDROCK. THE NEW TOOL IS GOING
TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS IN A MORE RELEVANT AND
CONVERSATIONAL STYLE BY
ACCESSING DELTA'S TRAVEL
POLICIES, REAL TIME FLIGHT
SCHEDULES, CUSTOMER REBOOKING
OPTIONS AND AIRPORT CONDITIONS.
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IT COULD
RESPOND TO SIMPLE QUESTIONS LIKE
HOW MANY BAGS CAN I CHECK ON A
DELTA FLIGHT? AND IT CAN ALSO DO
MORE COMPLEX QUESTIONS LIKE CAN
I CARRY MY CAT WITH ME IN THE
CABIN TO JAMAICA? OF COURSE.
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH YOUR CAT?
DELTA'S BEEN
TESTING WITH DIFFERENT
FOUNDATION MODELS IN BEDROCK,
INCLUDING ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 2.0
CLAUDE INSTANT AND A FINE TUNED
AMAZON TITAN TEXT EXPRESS MODEL.
AND THIS WAY THEY CAN USE THE
RIGHT MODEL TO ANSWER DIFFERENT
CUSTOMER QUESTIONS IN. IT'S A
REALLY POWERFUL HOW THEY CAN
COMBINE THE MOST RELEVANT
INFORMATION NEEDED TO ANSWER ANY
SPECIFIC QUESTION. NOW, WITH THE
NEW CUSTOMER SERVICE TOOL
DELTA AIRLINES IS AIMING TO
PROVIDE A DELIGHTFUL AND
CONVERSATIONAL SELF-SERVICE
EXPERIENCE AND IT'S GOING TO
IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SO
EVERYONE WANTS MORE RELEVANT
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS,
RIGHT? AND BEDROCK IS MAKING IT
A LOT EASIER TO CUSTOMIZE THOSE
APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR OWN DATA.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU
WANT FMS TO DO MORE THAN JUST
PROVIDE USEFUL AND TARGETED
INFORMATION AND ULTIMATELY WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT IS TO USE
FMS TO TAKE ACTION TO ACTUALLY
GET THINGS DONE AND WE WANTED
YOU TO BE ABLE TO USE BEDROCK TO
COMPLETE ACTIONS LIKE BOOKING
TRAVEL, FILING INSURANCE CLAIMS,
DEPLOYING SOFTWARE, MAYBE
ORDERING REPLACEMENT PARTS. AND
THIS USUALLY REQUIRES
ORCHESTRATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE
SYSTEMS THAT OPERATE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S WHY A
FEW MONTHS AGO, WE INTRODUCED
AGENTS FOR BEDROCK. AND TODAY
I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS
POWERFUL FEATURE IS TODAY.
GENERALLY AVAILABLE. NOW WITH
AGENTS GENAI APPLICATIONS CAN
EXECUTE MULTI-STEP TASKS ACROSS
COMPANY SYSTEMS AND DATA SOURCES
FROM ANSWERING CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS ABOUT PRODUCT
AVAILABLE IOT TO TAKING A SALES
ORDER AND MORE AND BUILDING WITH
AGENTS IS REALLY EASY. FIRST,
YOU USE BEDROCK SETUP WIZARD TO
SELECT THE APPROPRIATE MODEL.
THEN YOU GIVE THE MODEL BASIC
INSTRUCTIONS TO HELP THE MODEL
UNDERSTAND HOW TO RESPOND. LIKE
YOU ARE A FRIENDLY CUSTOMER
SERVICE AGENT WHO HELPS
CUSTOMERS RETURN ITEMS. NEXT,
YOU SPECIFY THE LAMBDA FUNCTIONS
THAT EXECUTE THE API CALLS TO
RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION THAT'S
RELEVANT TO THE TASK. FOR
EXAMPLE, RETURN POLICIES OR
INVENTORY LEVELS. AND FINALLY,
YOU SELECT THE DATA SOURCES.
THEN YOU JUST SELECT, CREATE
AGENT AND BEDROCK, CONFIGURES
YOUR AGENT AND IT IS NOW READY
TO RUN WHEN THE AGENT RECEIVES A
REQUEST, IT USES ITS REASONING
CAPABILITIES TO ANALYZE AND TO
PLAN THE TASK. AND THE MODEL
WORKS OUT THE SEQUENCE OF STEPS.
THE INFORMATION NEEDED, THE APIS
TO CALL AND WHEN TO CALL THEM.
THEN IT EXECUTE BETZ THE PLAN,
TAKING ALL THE STEPS THAT IT
NEEDS TO GATHER THE INFORMATION
AND THEN COMPLETE THE TASK. ALL
IN THE BACKGROUND. NO NEED TO
ENGINEER PROMPT, NO NEED TO
TRAIN THE FMS. NO NEED TO
MANUALLY CONNECT SYSTEMS WITH
AGENTS. GENERATIVE AI IS
BECOMING AN INTEGRAL PART OF
YOUR BUSINESS. MAKING IT EASY TO
TAKE ACTIONS AND GET TASKS DONE.
NO HEAVY LIFTING REQUIRED SO
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW BEDROCK
IS MAKING IT EASY TO CHOOSE
AMONGST LEADING MODELS AND ALSO
HOW IT GIVES YOU SO MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA AND HOW IT CAN
HELP COMBINE THE POWER OF MODELS
INTO YOUR ORGANIZATION'S
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA'S AND YOUR
API TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION. BUT
YOU WON'T ACTUALLY USE ANY OF
THIS IN A SERIOUS WAY IF IT
ISN'T SECURE AND PRIVATE.
I MEAN, YOU DEMAND THE
SAME ROCK SOLID RELIABILITY. THE
SAME SECURITY FOR GENERATIVE AI
THAT YOU DO FOR ANY WORKLOAD,
AND YOU REALLY NEED THIS TO HAVE
NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS
THAN EVERYTHING YOU EXPECT FROM
AN AWS SERVICE. IT'S JUST LIKE
S3. EC2. RDS. BEDROCK HAS GOT TO
HAVE ENTERPRISE GRADE SECURITY
FEATURES TO MAKE YOUR DATA SAFE
AND PRIVATE, AND THAT'S WHAT IT
HAS. BEDROCK CUSTOMERS CAN TRUST
THAT THEIR DATA REMAINS
PROTECTED. NO CUSTOMER DATA IS
GOING TO BE USED TO TRAIN OR
IMPROVE THE ORIGINAL BASE
MODELS. WHEN YOU TUNE A MODEL,
WE MAKE A PRIVATE COPY OF THAT
MODEL. WE PUT IT IN A SECURE
CONTAINER AND IT GOES NOWHERE.
YOUR DATA IS NEVER EXPOSED TO
THE PUBLIC INTERNET, NEVER
LEAVES THE AWS NETWORK. IT'S
SECURELY TRANSFERRED THROUGH
YOUR VPC. IT'S ENCRYPTED IN
TRANSIT AND AT REST AND BEDROCK
ENFORCES THE SAME AWS ACCESS
CONTROLS YOU HAVE WITH ANY OF
OUR OTHER SERVICES AS BEDROCK
ALSO SUPPORTS A VARIETY OF
REGULATORY STANDARDS. IT'S HIPAA
ELIGIBLE. IT CAN BE USED IN
COMPLIANCE WITH GDPR. WE'VE
ADDED A BUNCH OF OTHER SECURITY
AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITIES,
INCLUDING INTEGRATIONS WITH
CLOUDWATCH TO TRACK USAGE AND
METRICS. CLOUDTRAIL TO MONITOR
API ACTIVITY AND TROUBLESHOOT
ACTIVITY. AND TODAY BEDROCK IS
SOC COMPLIANT. NOW THIS HELPS A
CUSTOMER ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS
CAN HAVE STRONG CONTROLS AND
POLICIES IN PLACE AND HELPS IT
BE USED IN EVERY BUSINESS. NOW,
BEYOND SECURITY, WE NEED
GENERATIVE AI TO BE DEPLOYED IN
A SAFE, TRUSTWORTHY AND RESPONSE
ABLE FASHION. LIKE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND
THAT'S OUR NORTH STAR FOR THE
CAPABILITIES THAT MAKE GENAI
SUCH A PROMISING TOOL FOR
INNOVATION. ALSO, DO INCREASE
THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE. WE'VE
GOT TO FIND WAYS TO UNLOCK
GENERATIVE AI AI'S FULL
POTENTIAL WHILE MITIGATING THE
RISKS. NOW, DEALING WITH THIS
CHALLENGE IS GOING TO REQUIRE
UNPRECEDENTED COLLABORATION AND
A TRULY MULTI-STAKEHOLDER EFFORT
ACROSS TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES,
POLICY MAKERS, COMMUNITY GROUPS,
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES AND
ACADEMICS. WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATING IN A LOT OF THE
GROUPS THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER
TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES EARLIER
THIS YEAR, I JOINED PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS
LIKE DARIO AS HE ANNOUNCED THAT
WE'VE MADE A SERIES OF VOLUNTARY
COMMITMENTS TO PROMOTING THE
SAFE, THE SECURE AND THE
TRANSPARENT DEVELOPMENT OF AI
TECHNOLOGY. AND JUST THIS MONTH,
I JOINED A UK PRIME MINISTER
SUNAK, FOR HIS AI SAFETY SUMMIT
TO DISCUSS NEW APPROACHES,
INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF THEIR
NEW AI SAFETY INSTITUTE. NOW AN
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF
RESPONSIBLE AI IS PROMOTING THE
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOUR
CONSUMERS AND THE APPLICATIONS
THAT ARE SAFE THAT AVOID HARMFUL
OUTPUTS AND THAT STAY WITHIN
YOUR COMPANY'S GUIDELINES. AND
THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO
ACTUALLY PLACE LIMITS ON WHAT
INFORMATION THE MODELS CAN AND
CAN'T RETURN. AND WE'VE BEEN
WORKING HARD HERE, AND TODAY
WE'RE ANNOUNCING GUARDRAILS FOR
AMAZON BEDROCK. NOW THIS IS A
NEW CAPABILITY THAT HELPS YOU
EASILY SAFEGUARD YOUR GENERATIVE
AI APPLICATIONS WITH YOUR
RESPONSIBLE AI POLICIES TO
CREATE A GUARDRAIL. BEDROCK
PROVIDES CONFIGURATION WIZARD SO
YOU CAN ENTER A NATURAL LANGUAGE
DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPICS THAT
YOU WANT. THE MODEL TO AVOID.
GUARDRAILS CAN BE USED WITH ANY
OF THE FOUNDATION MODELS
ACCESSIBLE VIA BEDROCK,
INCLUDING THE CUSTOM MODELS THAT
YOU CREATE THROUGH YOUR OWN FINE
TUNING AND YOU CAN ALSO USE
GUARDRAILS WITH AGENTS. SO NOW
YOU CAN HAVE A CONSISTENT LEVEL
OF PROTECTION ACROSS ALL OF YOUR
GENAI GENAI DEVELOPMENT
ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, A BANK
COULD CONFIGURE AN ONLINE
ASSISTANT TO REFRAIN FROM
PROVIDING INVESTMENT ADVICE OR
TO PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT
. AN E COMMERCE SITE COULD
ENSURE THAT ITS ONLINE ASSISTANT
DOESN'T USE HATE SPEECH OR
INSULTS OR A UTILITY COMPANY
COULD REMOVE PERSONALLY
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR PII
FROM A CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL
SUMMARY. SO WE'RE APPROACHING
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF GENERATIVE
AI IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT
WAY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT
IT TAKES TO REINVENT. HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO BUILD WITH THIS
TECHNOLOGY? WE JUST, AS YOU'VE
USED AWS TO REINVENT HOW YOU'VE
BUILT AND INNOVATE IT FOR YEARS
AND ULTIMATELY TO TRANSFORM HOW
YOUR ORGANIZATION OPERATES,
WHETHER YOU'RE MIGRATING
ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS,
BUILDING THE NEXT HOT STARTUP OR
OR DEPLOYING YOUR GENERATIVE AI
STRATEGY. OUR APPROACH REMAINS
THE SAME. UM, CUSTOMER
OBSESSION, INNOVATION AND A LONG
TERM VIEW OF WHAT JOINT SUCCESS
REALLY MEANS. TO TELL US MORE
ABOUT HOW HER COMPANY IS BUILT
ON AWS AND IS NOW REINVENTING
WITH GENERATIVE AI, PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE LIDIA
FONSECA, THE CHIEF DIGITAL AND
TECHNICAL OFFICER OF PFIZER.
THANK EVERYBODY. I'D LIKE TO
START BY ASKING HOW MANY
PATIENTS DO YOU THINK PFIZER
TREATED LAST YEAR? YOU MAY BE
THINKING IN THE MILLIONS, BUT IN
FACT WE TREATED 1.3 BILLION
PATIENTS WITH OUR MEDICINES AND
VACCINES. THAT'S ONE OUT OF SIX
HUMANS ON THE PLANET. A TRULY
HUMBLING, ACCOMPLISHED AGENT.
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BE
RECOGNIZED AS AN INNOVATIVE AND
ETHICAL COMPANY LISTED IN
FORTUNE'S WORLD'S MOST ADMIRED
COMPANIES. FORBES WORLD'S BEST
EMPLOYERS, AND TIME MAGAZINE'S
WORLD'S BEST COMPANIES, PFIZER
IS EXPERIENCING AN EXCITING
PERIOD OF INNOVATION AND GROWTH
WITH THE LAUNCH OF 90 MEDICINES
AND VACCINES IN 18 MONTHS. THIS
HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BY US OR ANY
OTHER PHARMA COMPANY. IT IS AN
INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS GOAL AND WE
ARE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 13
ALREADY LAUNCHED DIGITAL DATA
AND AI ARE CRITICAL TO OUR
SUCCESS. AS AND WHAT
DIFFERENTIATES PFIZER IS THAT WE
APPLY THIS ACROSS ALL BUSINESS
UNITS. OUR 36 PLANTS AND THE 149
MARKETS THAT WE SERVE QUICKLY
AND AT SCALE TO BRING MEDICINES
TO PATIENTS FASTER. OUR SUCCESS
TODAY RESTS ON THE GROUNDWORK WE
LAID FOR TECHNOLOGY AND AI TO
FLOURISH. CENTRAL IZING OUR
DATA, CREATE STANDARD PLATFORMS,
CULTIVATING STRONG TALENT AND
BUILDING A SECURE FOUNDATION IN
ALL TO INNOVATE FOR MAXIMUM
IMPACT. WE COULD NOT HAVE
ACHIEVED THIS TREMENDOUS REACH
WITHOUT OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
WITH AWS. SO LET ME SHARE A BIT
ABOUT OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER. IN
2019 PFIZER AND AWS CREATED A
PIONEERING SCIENCE DATA CLOUD
THAT AGGREGATES MULTIMODAL DATA
FROM HUNDREDS OF LABORATORY
INSTRUMENTS, EMPOWERING OUR
SCIENTISTS TO SEARCH ALL
HISTORICAL MOLECULE AND COMPOUND
DATA IN REAL TIME COMPARED TO
WEEKS OR MONTHS IN OUR PRIOR
FRAGMENTED ENVIRONMENT AND THE
SCIENTIFIC DATA CLOUD
ACCELERATES ANALYSIS AND
COMPUTATION OF RESEARCH AND WITH
AI ALGORITHMS THAT HELP US
IDENTIFY AND DESIGN THE MOST
PROMISING NEW MOLECULES IS
BUILDING ON THAT SUCCESS IN
2021. PFIZER EMBARKED ON ONE OF
OUR BOLDEST INITIATIVE IS GOING
FROM 10% OF OUR CORE IN THE TO
CLOUD 80% MOVING IN 12,000
APPLICATIONS AND 8000 SERVERS IN
42 WEEKS. ONE OF THE FASTEST
MIGRATIONS FOR A COMPANY OUR
SIZE. THIS MOVE TO AWS SAVED US
$47 MILLION A YEAR AND HELPED US
EXIT THREE DATA CENTERS,
REDUCING 4700 TONS OF CO2
EMISSIONS OR THE EQUIVALENT
ENERGY USE BY 1000 HOMES IN A
YEAR. BUT VERY IMPORTANT ALI. IT
ENABLED US TO INNOVATE WITH
SPEED AND AT SCALE. FOR EXAMPLE,
WE REDUCED TIME TO SET UP
COMPUTING CAPACITY FROM MONTHS
TO HOURS, SPEEDING UP DATA
GENERATION FOR DRUG SUBMISSIONS
BY. 75. AND WHEN COVID HIT, AWS
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO OFFER
THEIR HELP, SCALING US INTO THE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL
CORES IN THE CLOUD AND
ACCELERATING MANUFACTURING AND
CLINICAL TRIALS. WHEN WE RAN
COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE
ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO
MANUFACTURE OUR COVID VACCINE,
AWS JUMPED IN WITH ADDITIONAL
CPUS FOR US TO MOVE FAST. AND
WHEN WE NEEDED TO SUBMIT DATA TO
THE FDA IN UNDER A DAY,
INCREASED OUR CAPACITY IN
ENABLING PFIZER TO MOVE AT THE
SPEED OF SCIENCE. IN FACT, IT
TOOK JUST 269 DAYS FROM WHEN WE
ANNOUNCED OUR PLANS TO DEVELOP A
COVID 19 VACCINE WITH BIONTECH
TO THE DAY THAT WE RECEIVED THE
FDA'S EMERGENCY USE
AUTHORIZATION ACTION. THIS
NORMALLY TAKES 8 TO 10 YEARS.
THANK YOU. WITH THE WORLD
WAITING, WE NEEDED TO
MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE THE
VACCINE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
WE HELD FIRM TO OUR MANTRA
SCIENCE WILL WIN. WELL WHILE
SCIENCE DID WIN AND DIGITAL
HELPED US DO IT FASTER, PFIZER
OUR INDUSTRY LEADING DIGITAL
OPERATIONS CENTER ALLOWED US
COLLEAGUES TO SEE PRODUCTION
STATUS ACROSS PLANTS AND RESOLVE
ISSUES IN REAL TIME, YIELDING A
20% THROUGHPUT INCREASE. OUR
MRNA PREDICTION ALGORITHM
YIELDED 20,000 MORE VACCINE
DOSES PER BATCH. IMAGINE THE
LIVES IMPACT IT. TO GIVE YOU AN
IDEA OF THE SCALE, PRIOR TO
COVID, PFIZER PRODUCED 220
MILLION VACCINE DOSES IN TOTAL
AND SCALED TO 4 BILLION OF
COMMUNITY IN 2022. THIS IS NOW
AT THE HEART OF HOW OUR PLANTS
OPERATE, AND WE'RE APPLYING
THESE INNOVATIONS TO THE TO OUR
OTHER MEDICINES AND VACCINES.
MORE RECENTLY, AWS HELPED US
APPLY AI TO GENERATE ALERTS
ABOUT POTENTIAL SUPPLY CHAIN
DISRUPTIONS, PROMPTING US TO
REROUTE SHIPMENTS TO CONTINUE
DELIVERING MEDICINES TO CLINICAL
TRIAL SITES AHEAD OF HURRICANE
IAN'S LANDFALL. DIGITAL AI MADE
IT POSSIBLE FOR PFIZER TO BRING
MEDICINES TO PATIENTS AROUND THE
GLOBE FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE.
NOW LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S NEXT.
AS YOU HEARD, PFIZER HAS BEEN
HARNESSING AI TO DRIVE
INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY ON A
GLOBAL SCALE. AND MORE RECENTLY,
WE ARE LEVERAGING GENERATIVE AI,
WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO DELIVER
ANNUAL COST SAVINGS OF 750
MILLION TO $1 BILLION IN THE
NEAR TERM. SOME REAL TANGIBLE
VALUE TO USING AWS CLOUD
SERVICES. PFIZER QUICKLY
DEPLOYED FOX OUR INTERNAL
GENERATIVE AI PLATFORM ALLOWING
COLLEAGUES TO ACCESS LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS AVAILABLE IN
AMAZON BEDROCK AND SAGEMAKER AWS
BREADTH OF SERVICES AND THE
VARIETY OF LMS IN BEDROCK MEANS
WE CAN SELECT THE BEST TOOLS FOR
USE CASES IN R&D, MANUFACTURE,
MARKETING AND MORE ENABLING
PFIZER AND AWS TO PROTOTYPE 17
DIFFERENT USE CASES IN A MATTER
OF WEEKS. I IN GENERATIVE AI
WILL HELP US IDENTIFY NEW
ONCOLOGY TARGETS, A PROCESS THAT
IS LARGELY MANUAL TODAY WITH AI,
WE CAN SEARCH AND COLLATE
RELEVANT DATA AND SCIENTIFIC
CONTENT FROM MANY MORE SOURCES
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME AND
ALGORITHMS GENERATE AND VALIDATE
POTENTIAL TARGETS TO IMPROVE OUR
SCIENTIFIC SUCCESS WITH BEDROCK,
WE CAN SCAN THE MARKETPLACE FOR
COMPANIES AND ASSETS AUTOMATING
THE CREATION OF COMPANY PROFILES
TO PRIORITIZE POTENTIAL
ACQUISITION ROLES IN
MANUFACTURING. BEDROCK TAKES THE
OPTIMAL PROCESS PARAMETERS TO
IDENTIFY WHAT WE CALL THE GOLDEN
BATCH AND USES GENERATIVE AI TO
DETECT ANOMALIES AND RECOMMEND
ACTIONS TO OUR OPERATORS IN REAL
TIME. AIMING TO IMPROVE CYCLE
TIME BY 25% AWS IS AGILE CULTURE
ALIGNS WELL WITH PFIZER'S
LIGHTSAIL LEAD WAY OF WORKING.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING ON
OUR LEARNINGS TO UNDERSTAND AND
NOT JUST HOW AI CAN TRANSFORM
OUR DAILY WORK, BUT HOW IT MAY
HELP US DISRUPT THE INDUSTRY.
ORI TO CLOSE, WE'RE EXCITED TO
ACCELERATE OUR BATTLE AGAINST
CANCER. WITH PFIZER'S PROPOSED
ACQUISITION OF CDN, A BIOTECH
FOCUSED ON CANCER THERAPY. AS WE
PLAN TO BRING JENS LEADING EDGE
ANTIBODY DRUG CONJUGATE
TECHNOLOGY TO MORE PATIENTS WITH
CANCER, FASTER. YOU SEE, WE HOPE
TO ACHIEVE WITH CANCER WHAT WE
WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH COVID.
OUR WORK WITH THE AWS WILL HELP
US CONTINUE THIS GREAT MOMENTUM
FUELING OUR AMBITION TO CHANGE A
BILLION LIVES EVERY YEAR, NOT
JUST IN A PANDEMIC YEAR. THANK
YOU, AWS FOR HELPING PFIZER
BRING BREAKTHROUGHS TO PATIENTS
FASTER BECAUSE IN THE BATTLE
AGAINST DISEASE, TIME IS LIFE.
THANK YOU ALL. ONE OUT OF EVERY
SIX PEOPLE ON THE PLANET ARE
IMPACTED BY PFIZER. I MEAN, THAT
IS JUST SO IMPRESSIVE. SO
IMPRESSIVE. LYDIA MEANS SO MUCH
TO US, HONESTLY, THAT YOU'VE
TRUSTED AWS TO. TO HELP DELIVER
ALL THESE CAPABILITIES. THESE
BREAKTHROUGHS THAT ARE CHANGING
PEOPLE'S LIVES. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. AND THANK YOU, ADAM AWS
HAS JUST BEEN AN AMAZING
PARTNER. THANK YOU. WE LOOK
FORWARD TO MORE. THANK YOU,
EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. SO
ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE
ARE USING AWS FOR AGILITY FOR
SPEED AND FOR THE SCALE THAT
THEY NEED TO DRIVE THEIR
FUTURES. BUT THIS REQUIRES
EMPLOYEES WITH TOP NOTCH CLOUD
SKILLS. AND WE KNOW THAT NOT
ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE THAT CLOUD
EXPERTISE AND THAT THERE'S A
LARGE SKILL GAP THAT'S GOT TO BE
CLOSED. SO GENERATIVE AI IS OF
COURSE, THE NEXT INCREDIBLY
EXCITING NEW OPPORTUNITY. BUT
IT'S ONLY GOING TO ADD TO THAT
GAP. AND SO WE'RE INVESTING TO
HELP PROVIDE THE CLOUD SCALE
SKILLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
NEEDED ACROSS THE WORLD FOR
YEARS TO COME. AWS IS COMMITTED
TO TRAINING 29 MILLION PEOPLE
FOR FREE WITH CLOUD COMPUTING
SKILLS BY THE YEAR 2025. AND
WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY WITH 21
MILLION ALREADY TRAINED. AND WE
JUST LAUNCHED WE JUST RECENTLY
LAUNCHED THE AWS CLOUD
INSTITUTE, WHICH IS PROVIDING
DEEP CLOUD EXPERTISE TO HELP
STUDENTS LAUNCH AN ENTIRE CLOUD
CAREER. AND WE'VE ALSO LAUNCHED
100 DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING
AND AI COURSES AND RESOURCES TO
SUPPORT INNOVATION AND JUST OVER
A WEEK AGO, WE ANNOUNCED AI
READY, WHICH IS OUR NEW
COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE FREE AI
SKILLS TO ANOTHER 2 MILLION
PEOPLE BY 2025 AND TO HELP
STUDENTS AROUND THE WORLD WITH
TO LEARN THE FOUNDATION SKILLS
AND TO PREPARE FOR A CAREER IN
TECH. WE ACTUALLY CREATED AN AI
AND MACHINE LEARNING SCHOLARSHIP
FUND. LET'S MEET SOME OF THE
RECIPIENT. THIS. MY NAME IS
VANIA GAREWAL. MY NAME IS JOSE
TAPIA. MY NAME IS OLYMPIA
OTIENO. WITHOUT THE AI/ML
SCHOLARSHIP, I WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP MY OWN
QUESTIONS. KNOW WHAT TOOLS ARE
AVAILABLE TO SOLVE THEM. THE
NANODEGREE IS DEFINITELY
UNLOCKED. MY INTEREST IN AI
CONSTANTLY TRY TO GO OUT THERE
AND TALK TO GIRLS WHO ARE
CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN
LIFE IN KENYA DUE TO CROP
DISEASE WIZ THE RATES AT WHICH
THE YIELDS HAVE BEEN DROPPING IS
DEVASTATING. SO MY COLLEAGUES
AND I HAVE MADE A MOBILE
APPLICATION WITH AI FARMERS
PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE CROP
DISEASES. THE FACT THAT I WAS
ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM,
I NOW KNOW THAT I AM CAPABLE OF
DOING WELL IN THIS FIELD. I
MEAN, THIS IS WHY WE DO THIS
STUFF, RIGHT? WHAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE
JOSE AND OLYMPIA HERE WITH US
TODAY. SO COME ON, LET'S GIVE
THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THERE
WE GO. TO BOTH OF YOU. I'M SO
PROUD. I'M REALLY PROUD OF WHAT
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE. AND I JUST
REALLY HOPE THAT REINVENT THIS
WEEK IS JUST A GREAT, GREAT
EXPERIENCE FOR YOU. THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR LETTING US SHARE YOUR
STORIES AND FOR EVERYONE
WATCHING, WE WANT TO EMPOWER ALL
OF YOU TO BUILD AND TO HAVE THAT
KIND OF IMPACT. AND WE SEE A
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THAT BY
INFUSING GENERATIVE AI INTO ALL
OF THE SYSTEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE
USING INTO THEIR DAILY LIVES. WE
BELIEVE THAT GENERATIVE AI
SHOULD HELP EVERYONE AT WORK
SEAMLESSLY WITH HELPFUL,
RELEVANT ASSISTANCE. WHETHER OR
NOT, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST THING
ABOUT FOUNDATION MODELS IS RAG
OR ANY OF THE REST. AND THAT
BRINGS US TO THE TOP OF THE
STACK, THE APPLICATIONS THAT YOU
USE THAT ARE POWERED BY
GENERATIVE AI, LEVERAGING
FOUNDATION MODELS. WE BELIEVE
THAT GENERATIVE AI, OF COURSE,
HAS THE POTENTIAL OVER TIME TO
TRANSFORM VIRTUALLY EVERY
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THAT WE
KNOW. IT CAN POUR THROUGH THE
NOOKS AND CRANNIES OF A SYSTEM
AND ACTUALLY HELP YOU FIND DATA
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
EXISTED. AND THEN HELP YOU PUT
IT TO OPTIMAL USE. IT CAN
GENERATE INSIGHTS THAT CAN SAVE
HOURS OF MANUAL WORK AND IT CAN
TAKE PROJECTS THAT WERE SLOGS
AND MAKE THEM A SNAP. NOW, ONE
IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS HOW
GENERATIVE AI CAN MAKE THE TASK
OF WRITING CODE RADICALLY
FASTER. AND SO LAST YEAR WE
RELEASED AMAZON CODEWHISPERER,
WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD GENERATIVE
AI, WHICH HELPS YOU BUILD
APPLICATIONS, I SHOULD SAY,
FASTER AND MORE SECURELY BY
GENERATING CODE SUGGESTIONS IN
NEAR REAL TIME. NOW WITH
CODEWHISPERER DEVELOPERS USE A
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPT AND THEN
RECEIVE ACCURATE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN EVERY POPULAR IDE
. AND FOR 15 OF THE MOST POPULAR
PROGRAMING LANGUAGES, A
CODEWHISPERER GIVES DEVELOPERS A
POWERFUL BOOST FOR GENERAL CODE
EXAMPLES. AND OF COURSE WE MADE
SURE THAT IT'S GREAT FOR
PROVIDING SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS
FOR CODE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING
WARNER MUSIC GROUP, THE
BUNDESLIGA AND THE CIGNA GROUP
HAVE EMBRACED CODEWHISPERER TO
ACCELERATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT
CAPABILITIES, AND TATA
CONSULTANCY SERVICES, AWS,
ACCENTURE AND HCLTECH ARE MAKING
CODEWHISPERER AVAILABLE TO TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES EACH.
NOW COHEN IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN
THE ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR
INDUSTRY. THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT CODEWHISPERER IS A GAME
CHANGER FOR THEM AND WE WANT AS
MANY DEVELOPERS AS POSSIBLE TO
REAP THE BENEFITS. AND SO WHAT
WE'VE DONE IS TO MAKE CODE
WHISPERER, TO MAKE THE CODE
SUGGESTIONS IN IT FREE, FREE FOR
INDIVIDUAL USE. NOW THE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CODE
WHISPERS ARE GREAT FOR GENERAL
CODING TASKS, BUT GENERAL CODING
SUGGESTIONS CAN ONLY GET YOUR
DEVELOPERS SO FAR. IMAGINE
YOU'VE JUST HIRED A NEW
DEVELOPER FOR EVEN IF THEY ARE
WORLD CLASS, THEY ARE NOT GOING
TO DO THEIR BEST WORK UNTIL THEY
UNDERSTAND YOUR CODE BASE AND
YOUR INTERNAL BEST PRACTICES. AN
AI POWERED CODING TOOLS ARE
SIMILAR. YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT
TOOL, BUT FOR THE KIND OF SPEED
AND RELEVANCY THAT MAKES THE
MOST DIFFERENCE, YOUR SOLUTION
HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF
YOUR CODE AND THE BEST PLACE TO
FIND THAT CONTEXT IS INSIDE OF
YOUR INTERNAL APIS, YOUR
LIBRARIES AND YOUR PACKAGES.
THAT'S WHY A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AGO WE PREVIEWED A CAPABILITY
THAT ALLOWS CODEWHISPERER TO
SECURELY LEARN FROM YOUR
INTERNAL CODE BASE TO PROVIDE
MUCH, MUCH MORE PERTINENT,
CUSTOMIZED AND USEFUL CODE
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS. CODEWHISPERER IS
AN EXPERT ON YOUR CODE AND CAN
PROVIDE MUCH MORE TAILORED
SUGGESTIONS. CREATING AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR INTERNAL
SDKS, YOUR APIS, YOUR LANGUAGES
AND YOUR CLASSES. AND OF COURSE
ANY CUSTOMIZATIONS ARE ISOLATE
AND WE NEVER USE CUSTOMERS
CONTENT FROM CODEWHISPERER TO
TRAIN ANY OF OUR UNDERLYING
MODELS. NOW TO UNDERSTAND THE
IMPACT OF THIS KIND OF
CUSTOMIZATION, WE WORKED WITH
PERSISTENT A DIGITAL ENGINEERING
PROVIDER. NOW
THEIR STUDIES SHOWED THAT
DEVELOPERS USING CODEWHISPERER
COMPLETED THEIR TASKS AN
ADDITIONAL 28% FASTER WITH
CUSTOMIZATIONS THAN WITHOUT 28.
AND AWS IS THE ONLY MAJOR CLOUD
PROVIDER THAT'S CURRENTLY
AUTHORIZING OFFERING A
CUSTOMIZED CAPABILITY THAT
ANYONE CAN SIGN UP FOR AND USE
TODAY. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT CODEWHISPERER ABOUT
CODEWHISPERER CUSTOMIZATIONS AND
HOW IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU
ACCELERATE YOUR WORK AND
INCREASE YOUR IMPACT. BUT WE'RE
JUST GETTING STARTED AND WE SEE
A LOT MORE POTENTIAL USES WITH
GENERATIVE AI. FOR EXAMPLE,
THINK ABOUT GENERATIVE AI CHAT
APPLICATIONS. SO THESE DAYS IT
SEEMS LIKE JUST ABOUT EVERYONE
IS EXPERIMENTING WITH THEM,
RIGHT? AND WHAT THE EARLY
PROVIDERS IN THIS SPACE HAVE
DONE IS REALLY EXCITING AND IT'S
GENUINELY SUPER USEFUL FOR
CONSUMER OWNERS. BUT IN A LOT OF
WAYS, THESE APPLICATIONS DON'T
REALLY WORK AT WORK. THEY'RE
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR
CAPABILITIES ARE GREAT, BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR COMPANY. THEY
DON'T KNOW YOUR DATA, YOUR
CUSTOMERS OR YOUR OPERATIONS.
AND THIS LIMITS HOW HOW USEFUL
THEIR SUGGESTIONS CAN BE. THEY
ALSO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHO
YOU ARE AT WORK. THEY DON'T KNOW
YOUR ROLE, YOUR PREFERENCES,
WHAT INFORMATION YOU USE AND
WHAT YOU DO, AND DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO. SO CRITICALLY. OTHER
PROVIDERS WHO HAVE LAUNCHED
TOOLS, THEY'VE LAUNCHED THEM
WITHOUT DATA PRIVACY AND
SECURITY CAPABILITIES. THE
VIRTUE ALI EVERY ENTERPRISE
REQUIRES. AND SO MANY CIOS
ACTUALLY BANNED THE USE OF A LOT
OF THESE MOST POPULAR CHAT
ASSISTANTS INSIDE THEIR
ORGANIZATIONS. AND THIS HAS BEEN
WELL PUBLICIZED AND JUST ASK ANY
CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY
OFFICER OR CSO AND THEY'LL TELL
YOU YOU CAN'T REALLY BOLT ON
SECURITY AFTER THE FACT. AND
EXPECT IT TO WORK AS WELL. IT'S
MUCH, MUCH BETTER TO BUILD
SECURITY INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL
DESIGN OF THE TECHNOLOGY. SO
WHEN WE SET OUT TO BUILD
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS, WE
KNEW WE HAD TO ADDRESS THESE
GAPS, HAD TO BE BUILT IN FROM
THE VERY START. RIGHT? AND
THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M REALLY
PROUD AND EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
AMAZON MQ A NEW TYPE OF
GENERATIVE AI POWERED ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO WORK FOR YOU AT WORK
. Q LETS YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS
QUICKLY WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE
INTERACTIONS, YOU CAN EASILY
CHAT, GENERATE CONTENT, TAKE
ACTIONS, AND IT'S ALL INFORMED
BY AN UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR
SYSTEMS, YOUR DATA REPOSITOR WIZ
YOUR OPERATIONS. AND OF COURSE
WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT ROCK SOLID
SECURITY AND PRIVACY ARE. SO Q
UNDERSTANDS AND RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING IDENTITIES, YOUR ROLES
AND YOUR PERMISSIONS. IF A USER
DOES NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO
ACCESS SOMETHING WITHOUT Q, THEY
CANNOT ACCESS IT WITH Q EITHER.
AND WE'VE DESIGNED Q TO MEET
ENTERPRISE REQUIREMENTS AND
ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS STRINGENT
REQUIREMENTS FROM DAY ONE. AND
WE NEVER WANT BUSINESS CUSTOMERS
CONTENT. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
USE THAT CONTENT FOR. Q TO TRAIN
UNDERLYING MODELS. I REALLY
BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO BE
TRANSFORMATIVE. WE WANT LOTS OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO DO
LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK
TO BENEFIT FROM AMAZON. Q NOW,
AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. WE WANT Q
TO HELP DEVELOPERS AND BUILDERS
BE MORE EFFICIENT, MORE
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND MORE
PROFICIENT. SO FOR STARTERS,
AMAZON Q IS YOUR EXPERT
ASSISTANT FOR BUILDING ON AWS
NOW TO SUPERCHARGE WORK FOR
DEVELOPERS AND IT PROS? WE'VE
TRAINED AMAZON Q ON 17 YEARS
WORTH OF KNOWLEDGE SO IT CAN
TRANSFORM THE WAY YOU THINK,
OPTIMIZE AND OPERATE
APPLICATIONS AND WORKLOADS ON
AWS AND WE'VE PUT AMAZON. Q
WHERE YOU WORK, SO IT'S READY TO
ASSIST YOU IN THE AWS MANAGEMENT
CONSOLE AND DOCUMENTATION CHAN
IN YOUR IDP VIA CODEWHISPERER
AND IN YOUR TEAM CHAT ROOMS LIKE
SLACK, YOU CAN CHAT WITH AWS
CLOUD TO EXPLORE AWS
CAPABILITIES, LEARN UNFAMILIAR
TECHNOLOGIES, ARCHITECT
SOLUTIONS. ITS AN EXPERT IN AWS
WELL-ARCHITECTED PATTERNS LEARNS
BEST PRACTICES AND SOLUTION
IMPLEMENTATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK AMAZON Q HOW DO I
BUILD A WEB APPLICATION WITH
AWS? WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? IT'S
GOING TO ANSWER WITH A LIST OF
POTENTIAL SERVICES THAT YOU
COULD USE, SUCH AS AMPLIFY,
LAMBDA OR EC2, AND THEN IT'S
GOING TO OFFER REASONS WHY YOU
MIGHT CONSIDER EACH SERVICE.
FROM THERE YOU CAN FURTHER
NARROW DOWN YOUR OPTIONS THROUGH
NATURAL LANGUAGE, LIKE WHICH OF
THESE WOULD BE PREFERRED? IF MY
APP IS ONLY NEEDS TO RUN FOR A
FEW SECONDS AND ONLY HAS VERY
INFREQUENT TRAFFIC LAMBDA AMAZON
Q IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR
REQUIREMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION
AND IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE YOU
WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE
RECOMMENDATIONS. AND ONCE YOU'VE
CHOSEN A SERVICE, YOU CAN ASK
AMAZON. Q HOW DO I GET STARTED?
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU STEP
BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR
CONFIGURING THE SOLUTION PLUS
LINKS TO RELEVANT INFORMATION TO
DOCUMENT STATION AND SO ON. AND
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF
HOW AMAZON Q IS GOING TO HELP
YOU WITH YOUR WORK. FOR EXAMPLE,
IF YOU ENCOUNTER AN ERROR WITH
LAMBDA IN THE CONSOLE, YOU JUST
PRESS THE TROUBLESHOOT ROUTE
WITH AMAZON Q BUTTON, AND Q IS
GOING TO RESEARCH THE ERROR, AND
IT'S GOING TO SUGGEST HOW TO FIX
IT. AMAZON. Q CAN ALSO
TROUBLESHOOT YOUR NETWORK
CONNECTIONS AND IT CAN ANALYZE
YOUR END TO END NETWORK
CONFIGURATION AND HELP RESOLVE
OF CONNECTIVITY ISSUES QUICKLY.
THAT IS A HUGE TIME SAVER. NOW
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU HELP US WITH?
HOW ABOUT CHOOSING THE OPTIMAL
EC2 INSTANCE SO YOU CAN JUST
TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR WORKLOAD AND
GET AN ACCURATE, QUICK AND
ECONOMICAL INSTANCE TYPE
RECOMMENDATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
WHICH EC2 INSTANCE TYPES PROVIDE
THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE FOR
VIDEO ENCODING AND TRANSCODING
WORKLOADS SUPPORTING GAMING USE
CASES AND YOU GET YOUR
RECOMMENDATION. IT'S THAT EASY.
THIS IS ALL VERY COOL AND WE
EXPECT THAT AMAZON Q IS GOING TO
SAVE CUSTOMERS SO MUCH TIME IN
ARCHITECTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING
AND OPTIMIZING YOUR WORKLOADS.
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL THE Q CAN DO
FOR YOU. AMAZON Q IS ALSO GOING
TO BE IN THE IDP FOR DEVELOPERS.
IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE
CODE IN THE IDE OR YOU NEED TO
DIG IN INTO HOW A SPECIFIC
FUNCTION WORKS, AMAZON, Q AND
CODEWHISPERER IS GOING TO HELP
YOU GET UP TO SPEED BY USING ITS
DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF AWS AND ITS
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR CODE BASES
. SO YOU NEED TO ADD TESTS. JUST
ASK Q AND IT'S GOING TO
AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE THE TEST
FOR YOU. AND THIS IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
DEVELOPERS. BUT WE KNEW WE COULD
DO EVEN MORE TO HELP YOU BUILD
EVEN FASTER. FOR EXAMPLE, THINK
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO
BUILDING A NEW FEATURE. YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND REQUIREMENTS.
THINK THROUGH DESIGN, WRITE ALL
THE CODE, ADD TESTS, DOCUMENT
THE CODE AND SO ON, AND A FILE
COULD SPAN HUNDREDS TO EVEN
THOUSANDS OF LINES OF CODE. AND
THIS IS A DAUNTING TASK. IF
YOU'RE USING AMAZON
CODEWHISPERER IT'S GOING TO
GENERATE CHUNKS OF NEW CODE FOR
YOU, WHICH IS A REAL TIME SAVER
THAT STILL LEAVES ALL THE REST.
SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR
AMAZON. Q SPECIFICALLY, Q'S
FEATURE DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY,
WHICH IS GOING TO AUTOMATE THE
MULTI STEP DEVELOPMENT TASK OF
ADDING NEW FEATURES TO YOUR
APPLICATION. SO INSTEAD OF ALL
THAT WORK NOW YOU JUST WRITE A
PROMPT AND Q IS GOING TO USE ITS
EXPERTISE ENRICHED WITH AN
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR PROJECT
CODE, AND IT'S GOING TO DO ALL
THE HEAVY LIFTING FOR YOU. SO
AMAZON Q WILL CREATE THE DRAFT
PLAN, WHICH YOU CAN THEN
COLLABORATE AND ITERATIVELY
IMPROVE USING NATURAL LANGUAGE
CHAT UNTIL IT'S POLISHED AND
READY TO GO. AND THEN Q REALLY
KICKS INTO GEAR. IT'S GOING TO
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN ACROSS YOUR
FILES IN YOUR APPLICATION. AN
AND YOU REMAIN IN CONTROL USING
YOUR EXPERTISE TO REVIEW CHANGES
AND ENSURE THE VERY BEST
QUALITY. SO THIS IS HOURS OF
WORK THAT Q CAN DO FOR YOU WITH
JUST ONE GOOD PROMPT. AND THIS
FEATURE IS AVAILABLE TODAY IN
AMAZON CODE CATALYST AND WILL
SOON BE FULLY AVAILABLE IN THE
IDE. YOU WILL NOT CURRENTLY FIND
AN AI ASSISTANT FROM ANOTHER
MAJOR CLOUD PROVIDER THAT CAN DO
THIS FOR YOU TODAY. BUT WE'RE
NOT DONE YET. LET'S KEEP GOING.
WE KNOW THAT DEVELOPERS SPEND A
LOT OF TIME SLOGGING THROUGH THE
MUCK THAT COMES WITH MAINTENANCE
AND UPGRADES, MAINTENANCE AND
UPGRADES. BIG DEAL, RIGHT? SO
TAKE TAKE LANGUAGE VERSION
UPGRADES, FOR EXAMPLE. HOW MANY
OF YOU ARE USING OLDER VERSIONS
OF JAVA? BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO
TAKE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS TO
UPGRADE HANDS? OH YEAH. A LOT OF
THEM. SO MIGRATIONS ARE
INEVITABLY COME WITH A LOT OF
NUANCE AND EDGE CASES. AND SO
YOU END UP SPENDING A TON OF
TIME WRITING AND REWRITING THE
CODE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND
TRYING TO GET IT COMPILE TO
COMPILE AND WORK. AND SOMETIMES
THESE PROGRAMS TAKE SO LONG THAT
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE IN A
MIGRATION INFINITY LOOP. JUST AS
ONE ENDS, THE NEXT BEGINS. AND
IT'S NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE
TEMPTATION TO JUST MAINTAIN
STATUS QUO. BUT DOING THAT MEANS
THAT YOU MISS OUT ON PERFORMANCE
IMPROVEMENTS AND IT MEANS MUCH
WORSE THAT IT CAN ALSO OPEN YOU
UP TO POTENTIAL SECURITY
VULNERABILITIES. AND THAT'S WHY
WE BUILT INTO AMAZON. Q CODE
TRANSFORMATION, WHICH HELPS YOU
WITH UPGRADES TO TRANSFORM CODE
IN A FRACTION OF THE TIME THAT
IT TAKES TODAY. ALL THE
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO ALL A
DEVELOPER HAS TO DO IS ASK YOU
TO PERFORM THE CODE
TRANSFORMATION AND IT HANDLES
THE REST FROM IDENTIFYING AND
UPGRADING AND MANDATORY CODE
PACKAGE DEPOSITORIES AND
FRAMEWORKS TO REPLACING
DEPRECATED CODE AND
INCORPORATING SECURITY BEST
PRACTICES. CUZ EVEN GOING TO RUN
TESTS ON THE UPGRADED
APPLICATION VERSION. SO WE'VE
BEEN USING THIS, THIS
APPLICATION, THIS THIS
CAPABILITY INTERNALLY AND THE
RESULTS ARE STUNNING. SO WITH
AMAZON Q TRANSFORMATION IN A
VERY SMALL TEAM OF AMAZON
DEVELOPERS SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADED
1000 APPLICATIONS FROM JAVA
EIGHT TO JAVA 17 IN JUST TWO
DAYS. NOW I'M GOING TO SAY THAT
AGAIN, 1000 APPLICATION UPGRADES
IN TWO DAYS. THAT'S HOW LONG A
SINGLE APPLICATION UPGRADE USED
TO TAKE. I MEAN, THIS IS MONTHS,
MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS OF
DEVELOPER TIME SAVED A LOT OF
VERY HAPPY PEOPLE AT AMAZON OVER
THIS. I PROMISE YOU. SO TODAY,
AMAZON. Q CAN WORK ITS MAGIC ON
JAVA UPGRADES, BUT SOON YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT TO
HELP MIGRATE YOUR NETWORK LOADS
FROM WINDOWS TO LINUX. AND THERE
ARE A LOT OF APPLICATIONS OUT
THERE STUCK ON WINDOWS BECAUSE
OF THE SHEER EFFORT REQUIRED IN
MAKING THE MIGRATION. AND THIS
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HUGE COST
SAVINGS ON COSTLY LICENSING FEES
ON TOP OF THE INHERENT
PERFORMANCE AND THE SECURITY
BENEFITS. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE
OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION? ALL THE FOLKS IN
MARKETING, FINANCE, HR, PRODUCT
MANAGEMENT AND MORE? THERE'S SO
MUCH INFORMATION SPREAD ACROSS
YOUR ORGANIZATION'S DOCUMENTS,
VASS ALL OF YOUR DATA, ALL OF
YOUR APPLICATIONS, ASIANS AND
PEOPLE IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
ROLES, THEY STRUGGLE EVERY DAY
TO FIND THE INFORMATION THAT
THEY NEED TO AND THEN TRANSFORM
IT INTO MAKING DECISIONS AND
TAKING ACTIONS AND DOING THAT
FAST ENOUGH TO STAY COMPETITIVE,
OF FINDING RELEVANT INFORMATION,
MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS, TAKING
ACTION THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR,
RIGHT? YEP AMAZON. Q IS ALSO
YOUR BUSINESS EXPERT. Q HAS
CONNECTIONS TO OVER 40 POPULAR
ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS, SO EMPLOYEES
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION CAN ASK
COMPLEX QUESTIONS AND GET
DETAILED, ACCURATE, NUANCED
ANSWERS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO
THEIR ROLE AT WORK. AND AGAIN,
SECURE IS SECURE AND Q IS SECURE
AND PRIVATE. IT RESPECTS YOUR
EXISTING ROLES AND THE
PERMISSIONS THAT ARE GRANTED
UNIQUELY TO EACH USER. WE'RE
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, AND I
ACTUALLY WANTED TO SHOW YOU JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF AMAZON. Q AND
FOR YOUR BUSINESS IN ACTION. SO
TO PUT THROUGH Q PUT Q THROUGH
ITS PACES. PLEASE WELCOME AWS
OWN DR. MATT WOOD TO THE STAGE.
THANKS, ADAM, AND GOOD MORNING,
EVERYONE. I'M EXCITED TO GIVE
YOU A FIRST LOOK AT AMAZON. Q A
NEW TYPE OF AI ASSISTANT
DESIGNED TO BE AN EXPERT IN YOUR
BUSINESS WITH AMAZON. Q YOU CAN
GET QUICK, ACCURATE, RELEVANT
ANSWERS TO YOUR MOST PRESSING
BUSINESS QUESTIONS, ALL
DELIVERED SECURELY AND
PRIVATELY. GETTING STARTED WITH
Q IS SIMPLE AND TAKES JUST THREE
STEPS. FIRST, YOU CONFIGURE
AMAZON Q BY CONNECTING AND
CUSTOMIZING Q WITH DETAILS OF
YOUR OWN ORGANIZATION. THEN Q
CONNECTS TO EXISTING DATA
SOURCES LIKE S3 SALESFORCE,
MICROSOFT, GOOGLE SLACK AND MORE
SUPPORTING OVER 40 POPULAR
BUSINESS APPLICATIONS AND
SERVICES RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.
ONCE CONNECTED AMAZON Q STARTS
INDEXING ALL OF YOUR DATA AND
CONTENT, LEARNING EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR
BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES
UNDERSTANDING THE CORE CONCEPT
PRODUCT NAMES, ORGANIZATION,
STRUCTURE, ALL THE DETAILS THAT
MAKE YOUR BUSINESS UNIQUE, AS
WELL AS INDEXING THE DATA FROM
THESE SOURCES. Q ALSO USES
GENERATIVE AI TO UNDERSTAND AND
CAPTURE THE SEMANTIC INFORMATION
WHICH MAKES YOUR BUSINESS
UNIQUE. THIS ADDITIONAL SEMANTIC
INFORMATION IS CAPTURED AS
VECTOR EMBEDDINGS, ALLOWING Q TO
PROVIDE HIGHLY RELEVANT RESULTS
WHICH ARE TAILORED TO YOUR
SPECIFIC COMPANY AND INDUSTRY.
YOUR DATA REMAINS COMPLETELY
UNDER YOUR CONTROL AT ALL TIMES.
AMAZON Q NEVER SHARES IT
EXTERNALLY OR USES IT TO IMPROVE
ANY OF THE UNDERLYING MODELS,
AND THAT'S IT. SURPRISE. THERE
IS NO STEP THREE. JUST OPEN
AMAZON Q IN YOUR BROWSER AND
AWAY YOU GO WITH A FULLY
CUSTOMIZED, SECURE ASSISTANT WHO
IS AN EXPERT IN YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU COMMUNICATE WITH Q THROUGH
THIS FRIENDLY WEB APPLICATION
DESIGNED FOR EVERYONE IN YOUR
ORGANIZATION TO USE. Q KNOWS WHO
YOU ARE AND ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY
AND ROLE. AND BECAUSE Q
UNDERSTANDS YOUR BUSINESS
SEMANTICS, YOU CAN ASK FAR MORE
DETAILED AND NUANCED QUESTIONS
AND GET TAILORED ANSWERS FASTER
THAN EVER BEFORE FOR EXAMPLE,
YOU COULD ASK Q TO ANALYZE WHICH
PRODUCT FEATURES CUSTOMERS ARE
STRUGGLING WITH AND RECOMMEND
WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM AS SOON AS
YOU HIT ENTER. Q GETS TO WORK ON
UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION AND
PREPARING AN ANSWER. Q STARTS BY
CREATING A SET OF INPUT PROMPTS.
AUTOMATIC ALI. Q THEN USES ALL
OF THE BUSINESS CONTEXT
AVAILABLE TO FIND RELEVANT DATA,
INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS AND
PICKS THE BEST ONES BEFORE
COMBINING EVERYTHING TOGETHER
INTO A RESPONSE, ALL IN JUST A
FRACTION OF A SECOND, USING THE
POWER OF GENERATIVE AI AMAZON Q
REMAINS FAITHFUL TO YOUR
ORIGINAL SOURCES, CITING THEM IN
LINE SO THAT YOU CAN VALIDATE
THE INFORMATION EASILY. Q'S
EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE MAGICAL, BUT
THERE IS NO MAGICAL BLACK BOX
JUST GIVING YOU ANSWERS. YOU CAN
UPLOAD NEW WORD DOCUMENTS TO
CSVS AND OTHER FILES ON THE FLY.
GO TO Q TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS
RESPONSES, LETTING YOU ASK
QUESTIONS ABOUT AD HOC DATA
WHICH HASN'T YET BEEN ADDED TO
ANY CORPORATE SYSTEM. AND AMAZON
Q WAS BUILT WITH PRIVACY AND
SECURITY IN MIND FROM THE GROUND
UP. SO EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SEEK
INFORMATION TO WHICH WE DON'T
HAVE ACCESS, AMAZON Q RESPECTS
YOUR EXISTING ACCESS CONTROLS
ONLY RETURNING INFORMATION
YOU'RE AUTHORIZED TO SEE. ADMINS
CAN ALSO RESTRICT SENSITIVE
TOPICS FILTERING OUT
INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS AND
ANSWERS WHERE NECESSARY. FINALLY
AMAZON Q CAN TAKE ACTIONS ON
YOUR BEHALF THROUGH A SET OF
CONFIGURABLE PLUGINS? AS AN
EXAMPLE, IF YOU UPDATE, SAY,
YOUR TRAINING PRIORITIES, Q CAN
AUTOMATICALLY CREATE TICKETS IN
JIRA. NOTIFY LEADERS IN SLACK
AND UPDATE DASHBOARDS IN
SERVICENOW. Q ALLOWS YOU TO
INSPECT ACTIONS BEFORE THEY RUN
SO YOU CAN REVIEW THEM AND ADD
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AND
AFTER THE ACTION RUNS, Q WILL
LINK TO THE RESULTS FOR
VERIFICATION. SO IN SUMMARY,
AMAZON Q BRINGS AI ASSISTANT
INTO THE BUSINESS WORLD,
PROVIDING SECURE TO RELEVANT AND
ACTIONABLE GUIDANCE TAILORED
ENTIRELY TO YOUR COMPANY. WE
CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO TRY. Q AND
SEE HOW IT WILL HELP YOUR
ORGANIZATION WITH THAT. BACK TO
ADAM. THANKS A LOT. THAT WAS
AWESOME. AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR
BUSINESSES. EMPLOYEES ARE GOING
TO LOVE AMAZON. Q IS GOING TO
HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS AND DISCOVER
AND SYNTHESIZE NEW INFORMATION
AND LIFT FOLKS OUT OF MONOTONOUS
DRAG OF REPETITIVE TASKS. AND IT
IS GOING TO LOVE HOW ALL OF THIS
COMES WITH RIGOROUS SECURITY AND
PRIVACY. NOW, I KNOW AT LEAST A
FEW OF YOU OUT THERE ARE
WONDERING IF AMAZON Q CAN ACCESS
MY DATA? DOES THAT MEAN IT CAN
HELP WITH MY BUSINESS
INTELLIGENCE? YES. AND OF COURSE
THE ANDREW NG ANSWER IS A
RESOUNDING YES. SO WE'VE BEEN
WORKING FOR A WHILE TO MAKE
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE MORE
ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WITHOUT BI
EXPERTISE. WE THINK ANYONE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS
OF THEIR DATA USING NATURAL
LANGUAGE AND SO AMAZON
QUICKSIGHT OUR ML POWER BI
SERVICE NOW HAS AMAZON Q
FEATURES BUILT IN FIRST AMAZON Q
IS GOING TO HELP REDUCE THE TIME
THAT IT TAKES BUSINESS ANALYSTS
TO CREATE DASHBOARDS AND REPORTS
FROM HOURS DOWN TO MINUTES BY
LETTING THEM SIMPLY TELL AMAZON
Q WHAT THEY WANT TO VISUALIZE.
FOR EXAMPLE, REGIONAL SALES BY
PRODUCT IS A SANKEY DIAGRAM. Q
COMES RIGHT BACK WITH THAT
DIAGRAM. UM, AND YOU CAN ADD IT
TO YOUR DASHBOARD WITH EASE AND
YOU CAN TELL. Q TO FURTHER
REFINE THE VISUAL, SAY YOU WANT
TO CHANGE THE CHART TO A
VERTICAL STACKED BAR CHART BY
MONTH AND COLOR CODED BY REGION.
YOUR WISH IS Q'S COMMAND. WITH
Q, YOU CAN GET BETTER DASHBOARDS
FASTER, BUT EVEN THE BEST
DASHBOARDS DON'T TELL EVERY
ANGLE OF THE STORY. FOR, FOR
EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ASK AMAZON. Q
WHERE DID WE HAVE THE HIGHEST
SALES? AND YOU GET A GET A
RESPONSE CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR
BUSINESS DATA. YOU CAN ASK A
FOLLOW UP QUESTION EVEN AS
LITTLE AS ONE WORD LIKE LONDON.
AND BECAUSE Q MAINTAINS THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR CURRENT
CONVERSATIONS, YOU CAN GET
INSIGHTS FROM YOUR DATA QUICKLY.
ORI NOW ENABLING PEOPLE TO TALK
TO Q AND QUICKSIGHT IS A BIG
STEP FORWARD IN HELPING YOUR
ORGANIZATION BE EVEN MORE DATA
DRIVEN. BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
GETTING HANDS ON WITH DATA. A
LOT OF PEOPLE CONSUME DATA
THROUGH PRESENTATIONS AND
REPORTS, AND SO, SO MUCH OF YOU
DO AT WORK IS TELLING STORIES
WITH DATA. AND AS YOUR BUSINESS
EXPERT, Q IS HERE TO MAKE THAT
EASIER TOO. LET'S SAY YOU WANT
TO CREATE A MONTHLY REPORT ON
YOUR BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA.
YOU CAN ASK YOU TO WRITE A
MONTHLY REPORT ABOUT THE
BUSINESS AND MAKE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT MONTH.
AND Q IS GOING TO GIVE YOU
VISUALIZATION OPTIONS. YOU
CHOOSE THE ONES YOU WANT, AND
THEN Q WILL FORMAT THEM. AND IN
SECONDS YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL AND
COMPELLING STORY AND IT'S
COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE. YOU CAN
ACTUALLY ADD MORE CONTEXT TO THE
SECTION BY ASKING YOU TO ADD A
VISUAL OF THE USAGE TREND, AND Q
WILL GENERATE A SHORT SUMMARY.
AND THEN YOU CAN FURTHER TWEAK
IT BY MAKING IT LONGER, SHORTER
OR REFORMATTING IT TO BULLETS.
LET'S MAKE IT LONGER. ONCE WE'RE
HAPPY WITH THE STORY, WE CAN
SECURELY SHARE IT WITH OTHERS.
WITH AMAZON Q AND QUICKSIGHT YOU
NOW HAVE AN EXPERT BI ASSISTANT
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR BUSINESS ANALYSTS AND IT'S
GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR END
USERS TO GET ANSWERS TO AND
INSIGHTS FASTER. AND THESE NEW Q
CAPABILITIES AND QUICKSIGHT ARE
AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW TODAY. NOW,
A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE
TARGETED TO HORIZONTAL USE CASES
OR SPECIFIC LINES OF BUSINESS
AND AWS HAS APPLICATIONS IN
THESE AREAS TOO. SO OUR FIRST
SPECIALIZED LINE OF BUSINESS
SOLUTION WAS AMAZON CONNECT. SO
IT'S BORN IN THE CLOUD AND OF
COURSE, AMAZON CONNECT IS A
SCALABLE COST EFFECTIVE, EASY TO
USE. CONTACT CENTER APPLICATION
THAT'S REINVENTED CUSTOMER
SERVICE GENERATIVE AI THAT KNOWS
YOUR BUSINESS IS GOING TO HAVE
AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON THE
WHOLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
EXPERIENCE ACROSS SO MANY
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. YOUR
CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAMS ARE AT
THE HEART OF YOUR BUSINESSES
DELIVERING INTERACTIONS THAT
PEOPLE REMEMBER FOR GOOD AND FOR
BAD. SO GETTING THIS RIGHT
REALLY MATTERS IS TODAY CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS SPEND A LOT OF
TIME GATHERING INFORMATION FROM
CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR
QUESTIONS AND THEN THEY SPEND
EVEN MORE TIME SEARCHING FOR THE
RIGHT ANSWER. NOW CONNECT HAS
MADE THIS A LOT EASIER ALREADY
WITH MACHINE LEARNING
TRANSCRIPTION ANALYTICS, BUT WE
KNEW WE COULD MAKE IT EVEN
BETTER FOR YOUR AGENTS AND
CERTAINLY FOR THE CUSTOMERS
WAITING ON THE OTHER END OF THE
LINE FOR HELP. ENTER AMAZON Q
AND CONNECT AVAILABLE TODAY AND
THIS IS GOING TO GIVE CONTACT
CENTER AGENTS A MAJOR ASSIST
AGENTS CAN CHAT WITH. Q DIRECTLY
INSIDE OF AMAZON CONNECT TO HELP
THEM RESPOND QUICKLY TO CUSTOMER
QUESTIONS. LIVE CHAT WITH Q WITH
FAST ANSWERS IS GREAT, BUT WHAT
IF YOU COULD MAKE THE CALL
ITSELF THE PROMPT NOW INSIDE OF
CONNECT? Q IS ACTUALLY THERE ON
THE CALLS ASSISTING WITH
PROPOSED RESPONSES WITH
SUGGESTED ACTIONS, WITH LINKS TO
RELEVANT ARTICLES? NO TYPING
REQUIRED, SO CONTACT CENTERS,
SUPERVISORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
ARE ALSO GOING TO GET A
GENERATIVE AI BOOST CONNECT NOW
AUTOMATICALLY CREATES POST CALL
SUMMARIES THAT SUPERVISORS CAN
USE TO TRACK FOLLOW UP ACTIONS
AND TO UNCOVER AGENT COACHING
OPPORTUNITIES. AND FOR
ADMINISTRATORS, CONNECT CAN SET
UP CHAT BOTS AND INTERACTIVE
VOICE RESPONSES THROUGH SIMPLE
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROMPTS.
STREAMLINE LEARNING THE PROCESS.
AMAZON Q IS JUST THE FIRST OF
MANY SPECIALIZED INDUSTRY AND
USE CASE SPECIFIC SERVICES THAT
ARE GOING TO SUPERCHARGE AMAZON
Q SO STAY TUNED. AMAZON
CODEBUILD AMAZON Q BUILDER, YOUR
AWS EXPERT, AWS Q BUSINESS, YOUR
BUSINESS EXPERT AT AMAZON, Q AND
QUICKSIGHT YOUR BUSINESS
INTELLIGENCE EXPERT AND AMAZON Q
AND CONNECT YOUR CONTACT CENTER
EXPERT. ALL ENGINEERED TO OFFER
ASSISTANCE THAT REMAINS FAITHFUL
TO THE INFORMATION THAT YOU
CHOOSE TO FEED IT AND WITH THE
BUILT IN SECURITY AND PRIVACY
THAT YOU KNOW AND THAT YOU COUNT
ON FROM AWS THIS IS JUST THE
START OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP
TO REINVENT THE FUTURE OF WORK.
WE CONTINUE TO INNOVATE ACROSS
ALL LAYERS OF THE STACK TO BRING

APPLICATIONS AND CAPABILITIES
THAT CAN BE ENRICHED WITH THE
CONTEXT OF YOUR BUSINESS. AND
IT'S ALL ON AWS BUILT WITH OUR
HIGH BAR THAT GIVES YOU BROAD
AND DEEP CAPABILITIES, CHOICE
AND ENTERPRISE READINESS. BUT
IT'S SO EARLY IN THE GAME AND
WE'RE INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
DO TOGETHER. NOW, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING THAT CUSTOMERS ARE
GOING TO NEED FOR ANY OF THIS TO
WORK, AND THAT'S DATA. YOUR
DATA. NO ONE ELSE HAS IT. NO ONE
ELSE CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU CAN
. YOUR DATA IS KEY TO SETTING
YOUR ORGANIZATION APART FROM THE
PACK. AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED,
GENERATIVE AI HAS JUST MADE IT
SO MUCH MORE RELEVANT AND
IMPACTFUL WHEN YOU TAILOR YOUR
DATA. SO LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM A
LONG TIME CUSTOMER ABOUT HOW
THEY'RE USING DATA TO CREATE
FIRST CLASS EXPERIENCES FOR
THEIR CUSTOMERS. SO PLEASE
WELCOME TO THE STAGE, STEPHANE
DURACH, VP OF CONNECTED COMPANY
AT BMW.
THANK YOU. HELLO EVERYONE. IT'S
FANTASTIC TO BE HERE. I COULDN'T
AGREE MORE DATA IS KEY. THE
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCT COMPLEXITY IS
STRONGLY INCREASED. KING AND
DEVELOPMENT SPEED IS ESSENTIAL.
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW BMW IS
MASTERING DATA ACCELERATING THE
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND
DELIVERING BEST IN CLASS
EXPERIENCE TO OUR CUSTOMER
ANYWHERE. AND ANYTIME ACROSS THE
ENTIRE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO FROM
BMW TO MINI AND EVEN ROLLS-ROYCE
, BMW IS PROVIDING GAME CHANGING
VEHICLE ENTERTAINMENT AND
EXPERIENCE POWERED BY AWS. WE
OPTIMIZE OUR TECH STACK, IMPROVE
OUR WORKFLOW AND USE DATA BY
LEVERAGING AWS CLOUD TECHNOLOGY.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES.
CLOUD DATA, BMW CENTRAL DATA
LAKE BUILT BY BMW AND AWS HOSTED
DATA FROM OUR CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET AND BY UPLOADING UPHOLDING
THE STRICTEST DATA PRIVACY
STANDARDS ON TOP OF IT, TEAMS
CAN BUILD THEIR APPLICATION AND
MODEL AS WELL AS DEPLOY UPDATES
AND IMPROVEMENTS TOGETHER. WE
ARE EXPLORING INNOVATIVE USE OF
MACHINE LEARNING, INCLUDING
AMAZON SAGEMAKER. THIS AUTOMATED
DRIVING PLATFORM IS BY BMW IS
BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF
DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEM ON
AWS. THIS AUTOMATED DRIVING
PLATFORM IS CAPABLE TO HANDLE
SEVERAL HUNDRED PETABYTE OF DATA
FROM OUR GLOBAL TEST FLEET. WE
ARE ACCELERATE TESTING OUR
DEVELOPMENT, SIMULATING AND
VALIDATION PROCESS DRAMATICALLY
FOR OUR PRODUCT LAUNCH IN 2025
WITH OUR ROUTE OPTIMIZED
CHARGING SERVICES, WE ARE
PROVIDING REAL TIME TRAFFIC
CALCULATION BASED ON DRIVING
STYLE PREFERENCE TRAFFIC OR
AVAILABLE CHARGING STATIONS AND
MANY MORE. WE ALSO USE AMAZON
TECHNOLOGY LIKE ALEXA FOR OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
AND FIRE TV TO CREATE UNIQUE
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, INSIGHT,
THE VEHICLE, OUR CONNECTED
VEHICLE AI PLATFORM IS BUILT ON
AWS AND FORMED THE BACKBONE OF
THE LARGEST CONNECTED VEHICLE
FLEET WHERE DE FOR SOME MORE
EVEN EYE OPENING STATS, LET'S
DIVE IN. 20 YEARS AGO BMW
INTRODUCED ITS FIRST VEHICLE
CONNECTED VEHICLE AND WE COME
QUITE A LONG WAY SINCE THEN. AND
NOW THE BMW GROUP HAS THE
LARGEST CONNECTED FLEET WITH
MORE THAN 20 MILLION VEHICLES
GLOBALLY OVER THE LAST THREE
YEARS. WE MIGRATED THE CONNECTED
VEHICLE BACKEND TO AWS BY
UTILIZING THE GLOBAL PRESENCE OF
AWS IN MANY REGIONS WORLDWIDE.
WE ARE UPDATE ADDING MORE THAN 6
MILLION VEHICLES OVER THE AIR ON
A REGULAR BASIS. THE THOSE
NUMBERS ARE GROWING CONSTANTLY.
IT REQUIRES TO MANAGE MORE THAN
12 BILLION REQUESTS PER DAY WITH
OVER 1000 DIFFERENT
MICROSERVICES. ULTIMATELY, WE
ARE PROCESSING MORE THAN 110TB
OF DATA TRAFFIC PER DAY WITH A
REMARKABLE RELIABILITY. LOOK AT
THESE NUMBERS. I'M ALWAYS
IMPRESSED, HOWEVER, WITH OUR NEW
PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE. THIS
NUMBER WILL TRIPLE IN THE NEXT
TWO YEARS. LET'S CHANGE
PERSPECTIVE AND TAKE A LOOK AT A
COUPLE OF NUMBERS IN THE
DEVELOPMENT PHASE. MORE THAN
8500 SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
WORLDWIDE CREATE FIRST CLASS
CODE FOR OUR VEHICLE AND
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE BMW SERIES
RUN SEVEN SERIES RUNS ON OVER
500 MILLION LINES OF CODE. OUR
WORLDWIDE DEV OPS TEAMS EXECUTE
MORE THAN 110 SOFTWARE, BUILDS
EVERY DAY BY USING MORE THAN
60,000 VIRTUAL CPUS TO KEEP UP
WITH OUR DEMAND. WE USE AWS
SERVICES TO SCALE UP AND
ACCELERATE DEVELOPMENT WHENEVER
IT IS NECESSARY. LET'S TAKE A
DEEPER LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT.
TRADITIONALLY, BMW'S COMES FROM
A HARDWARE DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
AND EVERY DEVELOPER HAD TO DO
THE DEVELOPMENT WORK ON A
PHYSICAL TEST TRACK. TODAY WE
ARE USING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY
TO STREAMLINE OUR INFOTAINMENT
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. THE NEW
APPROACH ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE
TEST FUNCTIONALITIES REMOTELY TO
OUR GLOBAL DEVELOPER TEAMS. AN
EXAMPLE IS USING AMAZON EC2 FOR
VIRTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
IN ORDER TO IMPROVE
CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COLLABORATION.
OUR NEXT STEP IS TO EXTEND THIS
APPROACH TO BUILD A FULLY
VIRTUAL DIGITAL TWIN. NOW LET'S
TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND SOME
EXCITING FEATURES WE CREATED FOR
OUR MINI CUSTOMERS. ON THE
PICTURE, YOU CAN SEE THE MINI
INTERIOR. IT'S OUR WAY TO
EMPHASIZE BRAND TYPICAL DESIGN.
TAKE THE IMPRESSIVE ROUND ALI
DISPLAY IN OUR NEW MINI FAMILY.
AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, OUR SPEECH
IS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE DOMINANT
MODALITY FOR INTERACTING WITH
VEHICLES. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY
INTEGRATING ALEXA VOICE
ASSISTANT. HOWEVER, THIS YEAR WE
ARE RAISING THE BAR. WE WILL USE
ALEXA TECHNOLOGY TO BRING OUR
INTELLIGENT PERSONAL ASSISTANT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL. NOW LET'S
TAKE A SEAT IN THE BACK OF OUR
SEVEN SERIES. ONE OF OUR MOST
EXCITING FEATURE IS THE BMW
THEATER SCREEN. IT'S THE 30 INCH
SCREEN WITH AN EIGHT K
RESOLUTION. IT IS SPECTACULAR,
INTEGRATED IN THE CAR. IT GIVES
YOU A REAL CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE
WITH FIRE TV. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN
SEAMLESSLY ENJOY THEIR FAVORITE
SERIES AND MOVIES. IT'S OUR
STRONG COLLABORATION WITH AWS
AND AMAZON THAT UNLOCKS NEW
POSSIBILITIES, ENABLE US TO
THINK ABOUT THE CAR IN A NEW
DIMENSION. SO ONE LAST THING TO
GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE INTO THE
FUTURE. THIS IS THE BMW NEW
CLASS. THIS WILL LAUNCH IN 2025.
BMW HAS BEEN ALWAYS ON THE
FOREFRONT OF AUTOMOTIVE
INNOVATION. THE NEW CLASS WILL
BE A QUANTUM LEAP IN CUSTOMER
EXPERIENCE. IT WILL TAKE THE
DRIVING EXPERIENCE TO A NEW
LEVEL AS YOU CAN SEE, THE NEW
CLASS INTRODUCED A COMPLETELY
NEW INTERIOR WITH THE BMW
PANORAMIC VISION. WE DEVELOPED A
NEW HEAD UP DISPLAY TO PROJECT
INFORMATION PILLAR TO PILLAR,
AND FOR THE PERFECT DRIVER
ORIENTATION AND USER EXPERIENCE.
ALL OF THIS EMPHASIZES IMPROVE.
BMW IS MASTERING DATA
ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT
PROCESS AND DELIVERING THE BEST
IN CLASS EXPERIENCE TO THE
CUSTOMER ANYWHERE AND ANYTIME
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EXCITING AND
ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT
NOW. AWS AND THE BMW GROUP ARE
WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER TO
SHAPE THIS FUTURE. THANK YOU
ALL. GOODBYE AND I'LL SEE YOU
SOON. FOR AN INCREDIBLE DATA
PLATFORM YOU'VE BUILT AND THE
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE IT'S
CREATING FOR YOUR CONSUMERS.
JUST AMAZING. THANK YOU, STEFAN.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU, AS
ALWAYS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO
AS STEFAN HAS JUST MADE SO
CLEAR, SUCCESS WITH AI AS WELL
AS WITH NEARLY EVERY OTHER
BUSINESS PRIORITY RELIES ON
HAVING A STRONG DATA STRATEGY.
AND ONE QUESTION I HEAR FROM
CUSTOMERS FREQUENTLY IS HOW
SHOULD I THINK ABOUT DATA IN A
GENERATIVE AI WORLD? WELL, THE
ANSWER IS THAT FOR GENERATIVE
AI, YOUR DATA IS YOUR
DIFFERENTIATOR. NOW WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT CUSTOMIZATION THROUGH
BEDROCK CODEWHISPERER
CUSTOMIZATIONS, AMAZON TAILORED
FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND EXAMPLES
FROM DELTA AIRLINES AND PFIZER
ALL TAL ADDING CONTEXT TO YOUR
GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS WITH
YOUR OWN DATA IS ABSOLUTELY
CRITICAL TO PROVIDING VALUE.
NOW, IN EACH OF THESE EXAMPLES,
ALS, THE DATA USED TO CUSTOMIZE
THE APPLICATION HAS TO BE UP TO
DATE. IT HAD TO BE COMPLETE AND
ACCURATE. IT HAD TO BE
DISCOVERABLE AND IT HAD TO BE
AVAILABLE WHEN YOU NEEDED IT. SO
THE FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING ALL
OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE YOUR
DATA IS IN THE CLOUD. NOW,
GENERATIVE AI IS JUST ONE OF
MANY REASONS THAT YOU WANT THIS.
HAVING EFFECTIVE CLOUD BASED
DATA STRATEGY IS GOING TO
INCREASE YOUR INSIGHT. IT'S
GOING TO REDUCE YOUR COST AND
IT'S GOING TO ACCELERATE
INNOVATION. NOW, TO UNDERSTAND
THIS, JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MANY
DIFFERENT ISSUES THERE ARE TO
CONSIDER WHEN TRYING TO MAKE THE
MOST OF YOUR DATA. ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA. IT
COMES FROM DIFFERENT ORIGINS,
AND IT COMES AT VARIOUS SCALES
AND SPEEDS AS DIFFERENT TEAMS
ALL ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION ARE
GOING TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT
DATA IN MANY, MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF WAYS. AND THEN HOW YOU
WANT TO USE THIS DATA IS JUST AS
VARIED. YOUR STORING IT, YOUR
POWERING, YOUR APPLICATIONS,
YOUR ANALYZING IT, YOU'RE
GENERATING PREDICTIONS FROM IT.
THERE'S NO ONE TOOL OR SOLUTION
THAT CAN DO IT ALL UNLESS YOU'RE
WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES LIKE
PERFORMANCE COST OR
CAPABILITIES. BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE THOSE SACRIFICE CHOICES.
SO WHAT YOU NEED IS A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF TOOLS THAT
ACCOUNTS FOR THE SCALE AND THE
VARIETY OF THIS DATA AND THE
MANY, MANY PURPOSES FOR WHICH
YOU WANT TO USE IT. YOU NEED TO
INTEGRATE IT AND COMBINE ALL
THAT DATA THAT'S SPREAD ALL OVER
TO CREATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND PREDICT
WHAT WILL HAPPEN. AND OF COURSE,
YOU NEED GOVERNANCE SO THAT YOU
CAN HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE OF
ACCESS AND CONTROL EVERY STEP OF
THE WAY. YOU NEED IT ALL. IF YOU
MISS EVEN ONE ASPECT, YOUR
ABILITY TO USE THAT DATA IS
SIGNIFICANTLY HOBBLED. SO IN
ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN
STORE, ANALYZE AND PROCESS THE
DATA YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF DATA
SERVICES SO YOU CAN GET THE
PRICE PERFORMANCE, YOU CAN GET
THE SPEED, THE FLEXIBILITY AND
THE CAPABILITIES FOR YOUR USE
CASE. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
BUILT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE SET
OF CLOUD DATA SERVICES OUT THERE
. SO TO START, WE HAVE AMAZON S3
AND CUSTOMERS USE S3 TO MAKE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DATA
LAKES WHERE THEY CAN BRING
STRUCTURED DATA TOGETHER WITH
UNSTRUCTURED DATA AND MAKE IT
ALL AVAILABLE FOR ANALYTICS AND
MACHINE LEARNING. WE ALSO OFFER
EIGHT RELATIONAL DATABASES,
INCLUDING AMAZON, AURORA THE
RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICE
THAT'S BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP
FOR THE CLOUD AND IS STILL THE
FASTEST GROWING SERVICE IN AWS
HISTORY. WE ALSO HAVE EIGHT
PURPOSE BUILT DATABASES, NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES, INCLUDING
AMAZON DYNAMODB, WHICH IS USED
BY OVER A MILLION DEVELOPERS
SORRY, A MILLION CUSTOMERS FOR
ITS SERVERLESS SINGLE DIGIT
MILLISECOND PERFORMANCE AT ANY
SCALE. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE
BROADEST AND DEEPEST SET OF
ANALYTICS SERVICES AND THIS
INCLUDES OUR DATA WAREHOUSE
SERVICE, AMAZON REDSHIFT, WHICH
DELIVERS UP TO SIX OR EVEN SEVEN
TIMES BETTER PRICE PERFORMANCE
DEPENDING ON YOUR WORKLOAD THAN
OTHER CLOUD DATA WAREHOUSES.
WE'VE GOT AMAZON EMR TO EASILY
RUN SPARK AND OTHER BIG DATA
WORKLOADS AND AMAZON OPENSEARCH
SERVICE WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF ACTIVE CUSTOMERS AND HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF CLUSTERS UNDER
MANAGEMENT. AND THAT ALL
PROCESSES TRILLIONS OF REQUESTS
PER MONTH AND MANY, MANY, MANY
MORE ANALYTIC SERVICES. I WON'T
GO THROUGH THEM ALL, BUT YOU
NEED THIS BREADTH AND THIS DEPTH
OF CHOICE SO THAT YOU CAN NEVER
HAVE TO COMPROMISE ON COST, ON
PERFORMANCE OR ON SCALE, AND
INSTEAD YOU CAN CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOL FOR THE JOB. NOW, WE'VE
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT AI AND ML
EXTENSIVELY, SO I'M NOT GOING TO
DWELL ON THAT HERE. BUT YOU NEED
TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TOOLS TO FEED YOUR AI AND
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'RE
DOING IN YOUR BUSINESS. AND THE
SECOND THING THAT YOU NEED AS
YOU MOVE TO PUT DATA AT THE
CENTER OF YOUR BUSINESS IS TO
BREAK DOWN YOUR DATA SILOS. MOST
PEOPLE HAVE DATA SPREAD OUT ALL
OVER THE ORGANIZATION IN
DATABASES, ANALYTIC TOOLS, SAAS
APPLICATIONS, SPREADSHEETS AND
MORE. AND TO GET THE MOST VALUE
FROM YOUR DATA, YOU NEED TO BE
ABLE TO USE IT ALL. NO MATTER
WHERE IT LIVES. AND TO DO THIS
TODAY, MOST PEOPLE MOVE DATA
AROUND OR TRY TO CONNECT THE
VARIOUS SILOS USING A PROCESS
CALLED ETL OR EXTRACT, TRANSFORM
AND LOAD. YEAH, I SEE SOME OF
YOU FLINCHED WHEN I SAID THAT
BECAUSE YOU KNOW. RIGHT. YOU
KNOW EXACTLY HOW BAD THIS
PROCESS CAN BE. IT IS TEARING
ALL FIRST DEVELOPERS HAVE TO
DESIGN AN ETL PIPELINE
ARCHITECTURE. THEY HAVE TO
DECIDE WHERE TO EXTRACT THE DATA
FROM, AND IT'S OFTEN COMING FROM
MULTIPLE SOURCES. THEN THEY HAVE
TO WRITE CODE TO TRANSFORM THE
DATA AND REMOVE DUPLICATES. THEY
HAVE TO FILTER OUT OUTLIERS,
RETRIEVE MISSING DATA AND
IDENTIFY CORRUPTED DATA. AFTER
ALL THAT, YOU HAVE TO TRANSFORM.
YOU HAVE TO LOAD YOUR TRANSFORM
DATA TO ITS NEW DESTINATION,
WHICH ONCE AGAIN MEANS MORE CODE
TO WRITE. THEN, IF SOMETHING
CHANGES, LIKE A DATA ENGINEER
SWAPPING OUT A DATA TABLE OR
ADDING A NEW FIELD, YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK AGAIN AND UPDATE ALL OF
YOUR CODE ONCE MORE. IT IS
MONOTONOUS, IT IS TEDIOUS AND IT
IS JUST A WHOLE LOT OF UNFUN
WORK, WHICH IS WHY WE INTRODUCED
OUR VISION OF A ZERO ETL FUTURE
FOR AND IN THIS FUTURE YOU CAN
WAVE GOODBYE TO THE BORING,
FRUSTRATING PROCESS OF ETL. YOUR
DATA IS AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTED
FROM THE SOURCE TO THE
DESTINATION. IT'S THAT EASY AND
YOU GET YOUR DATA WHERE YOU NEED
IT WHEN YOU NEED IT. NO MORE
BUILDING AND MANAGING COMPLEX,
BRITTLE PROCESSES AND PIPELINES.
IT'S REALLY EXCITING. BUT IS IT
REAL? WELL, IS IT DOWN PAYMENT?
LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED A FULLY
MANAGED ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
BETWEEN AURORA, MYSQL AND
REDSHIFT. WITHIN SECONDS OF DATA
BEING WRITTEN INTO AURORA, YOU
CAN USE REDSHIFT TO DO NEAR REAL
TIME ANALYTICS AND ON PETABYTES
OF DATA. YOU CAN ENABLE THIS
INTEGRATION WITH JUST A FEW
CLICKS AND ZERO-ETL. IT IS
INCREDIBLY EASY NOW THIS FIRST
ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IS READY,
IS READY DONE. BUT WE'VE WE'VE
WE WANT TO DELIVER SO MUCH MORE.
AND SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TODAY
TO BE ANNOUNCING THREE MORE ZERO
ETL INTEGRATIONS WITH REDSHIFT.
LET'S GET THEM ALL DONE AT ONCE.
AURORA POSTGRES RDS FOR MYSQL
AND DYNAMODB. THESE ZERO-ETL
INTEGRATIONS AND AMAZON REDSHIFT
ARE ALL AVAILABLE IN PREVIEW
WHEN TODAY. SO. SO THAT MAKES.
YEAH. YOU DON'T LIKE THE MUCK,
DO YOU? SO THAT'S FOUR OF OUR
MOST POPULAR RELATIONAL AND NON
RELATIONAL DATABASES TOGETHER
WITH THE DATA WAREHOUSE THAT
GIVES YOU THE BEST PRICE
PERFORMANCE WITHOUT ANY OF THE
ETL FANTASTIC. BUT REMEMBER,
WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THIS VISION.
SO OF COURSE OUR NEXT QUESTION
WAS, WELL, WHERE ELSE COULD WE
BE REMOVING THE PAIN OF ETL?
NOW, MANY OF YOU NEED TO USE
SEARCH ON YOUR TRANSACTIONAL
DATA TO ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE
OF YOUR APPLICATION. SO FOR
EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE AN
E-COMMERCE APPLICATION AND YOU
WANT TO PROVIDE PERSONALIZED
RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOUR USER,
YOU USE SIMILARITY SEARCH ON
TRANSACTION DATA. THAT'S GOING
TO BE STORED IN YOUR DATABASE.
SO TO DO THIS CURRENTLY YOU'RE
DESIGNING, YOU'RE BUILDING,
YOU'RE MANAGING COMPLEX DATA
PIPELINE ARCHITECTURES FROM YOUR
DATABASE TO A SEARCH ENGINE. AND
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOU ARE
BUILDING THOSE PIPELINES TO
AMAZON OPENSEARCH SERVICE FOR
ITS POWERFUL SEARCH CAPABILITIES
. I BET YOU CAN TELL WHERE WE'RE
GOING WITH THIS. SO TODAY I'M
REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE UNVEILED
ONE MORE ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION IN
DYNAMO. DB ZERO-ETL INTEGRATION
WITH OPENSEARCH SERVICE
GENERALLY AVAILABLE TODAY. AND
THIS NEW INTEGRATION MAKES IT SO
EASY TO SEARCH DYNAMODB DATA
WITH OUR OPENSEARCH SERVICE. AND
IT'S JUST THE FIRST OF THESE
DATABASE INTEGRATIONS TO OUR
OPENSEARCH SERVICE THAT'S GOING
TO HELP YOU DO MORE WITH DATA.
SO OUR NEW ZERO-ETL INTEGRATIONS
ARE BRINGING TRANSACTIONAL DATA
AND ANALYTICS TOGETHER FASTER
AND MORE EASILY AND CUSTOMERS
ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE
IDEA OF A ZERO-ETL FUTURE. SO
YOU CAN BE CERTAIN WE'RE GOING
TO KEEP INNOVATING HERE. NOW
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE
TOOLS THAT YOU NEED AND HOW YOU
CAN HAVE DATA WHERE YOU NEED IT
WITHOUT THE PAINFUL ETL BURDEN.
NEXT YOU WANT TO EMPOWER PEOPLE
ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION TO USE
YOUR DATA TO ITS FULLEST AND YOU
WANT THEM WALLOWING IN YOUR
DATA, EXPERIMENTING, ASKING
QUESTIONS, SPARKING IDEAS. AND
YOU WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS.
BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM YOUR
DATA IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE, SO
YOU WANT TO GRANT ACCESS ONLY TO
THE RIGHT EMPLOYEES AT THE RIGHT
TIME. YOU NEED TO KEEP IT SAFE
AND SECURE. SO YOU ALSO NEED
CONTROL, YOUR ACCESS CONTROL.
KOHL THESE ARE OPPOSITES, RIGHT?
NO, YOU CAN HAVE IN FACT, YOU
MUST HAVE BOTH AND THE KEY TO
MAKING SURE THAT YOUR DATA IS,
IS SAFE, IS GOVERNED, HAS ACCESS
, IS GOVERNANCE CREATING
VISIBILITY INTO YOUR DATA AND
CONTROLLING WHO CAN ACCESS YOUR
DATA AND WHEN THEY CAN ACCESS IT
WITH ROBUST GOVERNANCE, YOU'RE
GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO
THE DATA THEY NEED AND ONLY THAT
DATA. AND WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT
DATA YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW WHERE IT
IS. YOU HAVE GUARDRAILS AND
TOOLS IN PLACE TO SAFELY UNLOCK
IT. THAT BUILDS CONFIDENCE. AND
THEN PEOPLE WITHIN THE
ORGANIZATION DEVELOP TRUST IN
THE DATA. YOU ACTUALLY EMPOWER
INNOVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION
RATHER THAN STIFLING IT. AND SO
TO HELP YOU WITH GOVERNANCE, WE
DEVELOPED AMAZON DATAZONE DATA
ZONES, A DATA MANAGEMENT SERVICE
THAT HELPS YOU CATALOG,
DISCOVER, SHARE AND GOVERN DATA
ACROSS YOUR ORGANIZATION. WE'RE
GETTING GREAT FEEDBACK FROM LOTS
OF DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS,
INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
LEADER IN BRAZIL, ITAU. AND
WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE
IMPACT THAT DATA ZONE IS HAVING
AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
INNOVATE RAPIDLY IN THIS SPACE.
TODAY, DATA ZONE USES MACHINE
LEARNING TO AUTOMATICALLY ADD
METADATA TO YOUR CATALOG, BUT IN
ORDER TO FIND THE RIGHT DATA AT
THE RIGHT TIME, CUSTOMERS STILL
HAVE TO CHOOSE TO ADD BUSINESS
CONTEXT LIKE EXPLAINING THE
DATA'S PURPOSE OR CLARIFYING THE
COLUMN DESCRIPTIONS. AND NOW
THIS HELPS EMPLOYEES FIND THE
DATA THAT THEY NEED. IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
KNOW THE DATA EXISTS, THE
QUESTION OF ACCESS AND CONTROL
BECOMES MOOT. BUT ADDING ALL
THIS DATA IS A METADATA IS
TEDIOUS. IT'S A MANUAL PROCESS.
WELL, NO LONGER. WE'RE MAKING
YOUR CATALOGING EVEN SMARTER.
AND TODAY I'M REALLY PLEASED TO
ANNOUNCE A NEW CAPABILITY THAT
AUTOMATICALLY SUGGESTS BUSINESS
DESCRIPTIONS TO ADD CONTEXT FOR
YOUR DATA SET IN JUST A FEW
CLICKS, CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS
SIMPLY CHOOSE A DATA SET AND
DATAZONE WILL USE GENERATIVE AI
TO CREATE BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS
FOR YOUR DATA. USING OUR TRAINED
MODELS. MAKING IT EASIER TO
UNDERSTAND THESE DESCRIPTIONS
CAN BE REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED, OR
EVEN FURTHER CLARIFIED OR EDITED
FOR YOUR EXACT PREFERENCES. DATA
ZONES ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO USE
YOUR DATA. THIS IS A HUGE, HUGE
TIME SAVER IN THIS CAPABILITY IS
GOING TO HELP EMPLOYEES TO FIND
THE RIGHT DATA FOR EVEN FASTER
INSIGHTS. WE'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO INNOVATE TO HELP YOU
USE DATA GOVERNANCE TO SET YOUR
DATA FREE. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
DO IN YOUR BUSINESS, YOU NEED AN
END TO END DATA STRATEGY THAT
PROVIDES CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE
ENTIRE SPAN OF YOUR DATA NEEDS.
YOU NEED TO EASILY CONNECT DATA
ACROSS SILOS AND YOU NEED YOU
NEED YOUR DATA TO BE GOVERNED TO
BE CONFIDENT THAT THE RIGHT DATA
IS USED IN THE RIGHT WAYS BY
ONLY THE RIGHT PEOPLE. WE'RE
MAKING AWS THE BEST PLACE FOR
ALL OF YOUR DATA NEEDS ACROSS
ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS.
AND WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS AND
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO MAKE DATA,
YOUR DIFFERENTIATOR IN AI AND
ACROSS YOUR BUSINESS, IT'S
AMAZING. WE'VE TALKED A LOT
ABOUT REINVENTION TODAY AND HERE
AT AWS THE MOST IMPORTANT
REINVENTION OF ALL IS YOURS TO
SUPPORT YOU IN ALL THE WAYS THAT
YOU WANT TO ADAPT AND EVOLVE. WE
CONTINUOUSLY CONTINUE TO
CHALLENGE OURSELVES. WE TRY AND
THINK DIFFERENTLY. WE TRY AND
GIVE YOU THE CAPABILITY WIZ THAT
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED, AND EVEN
SOME MAYBE THAT YOU'VE NEVER
IMAGINED. NOW, THIS ISN'T THE
WORK OF A FEW MONTHS OR EVEN A
YEAR, BUT WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT.
WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE AT
AMAZON WE MAKE BOLD BETS. SO
THIRD PARTY SELLING ON AMAZON
PRIME, EVEN AWS ITSELF IS A BIG
BET. I MEAN, IT TOOK A LOT OF
YEARS AND A LOT OF CAPITAL TO
BUILD OUT THE ON DEMAND
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES THAT
SIMPLY BECAME KNOWN AS THE CLOUD
FOR THIS LONG TERM FOCUS IS A
GOOD THING. BEING WILLING TO
THINK DIFFERENTLY AND LONG TERM
IS A GOOD THING. IT'S THE ONLY
PREDICTABLE WAY TO PROFOUNDLY
CHANGE WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR
CUSTOMERS. AWS. NOW THERE'S
ANOTHER BIG BET THAT AMAZON IS
MAKING YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF
PROJECT KUIPER AND YEAH, KUIPER.
KUIPER'S BUILDING A
CONSTELLATION OF THOUSANDS OF
LOW EARTH ORBIT SATELLITES. WHY?
WELL, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE ON EARTH LACK FAST OR
RELIABLE OR EVEN ANY INTERNET
ACCESS. PROJECT KUIPER IS GOING
TO HELP CLOSE THAT DIGITAL
DIGITAL DIVIDE BY DELIVERING
FAST, AFFORDABLE BROADBAND TO A
WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS
OPERATING IN PLACES WITHOUT
RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTIONS.
IN FACT, JUST LAST MONTH, KUIPER
, THE KUIPER TEAM SUCCESSFULLY
LAUNCHED ITS FIRST TWO PROTOSTAR
SATELLITES INTO ORBIT. IT'S JUST
INCREDIBLE THING. I MEAN, THEY
PUT SATELLITES UP THERE. THEY'RE
WORKING FLAWLESSLY. EVERYBODY'S
REALLY HAPPY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED
THERE RIGHT? WOW I MEAN, KUIPER
IS A GLOBAL HIGH SPEED SATELLITE
NETWORK THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE
COVERAGE IN PLACES THAT HAVE
NEVER HAD COVERAGE BEFORE. I
MEAN, IMAGINE THE POWER OF
DELIVERING A REALLY HARD TO
REACH PLACES, THE ABILITY TO
ACCESS THE INTERNET WITH THE
SAME SPEED. THE SAME RELIABILITY
THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED
EVERY DAY. NOW, THE
POSSIBILITIES FOR CONSUMERS IS,
FOR SURE, ENORMOUS. BUT SO ARE
THE BENEFITS TO BUSINESSES AND
GOVERNMENTS. AND THERE ARE ALL
SORTS OF USE CASES LIKE
RENEWABLE ENERGY PROVIDERS THAT
WANT TO ANALYZE IN REAL TIME
DATA FROM OFF SHORE WIND FARMS
OR FIRST RESPONDERS WHO NEED
FAST, RELIABLE CONNECTIONS
DURING NATURAL DISASTERS OR
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE LOOKING
FOR CONNECTIVITY, BACKUP IN CASE
OF AN UNPLANNED OUTAGE. KUIPER
IS GOING TO HELP TO MAKE ALL OF
THIS POSSIBLE AND AWS CUSTOMERS
ARE ALREADY PLANNING FOR THE
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS OPENS UP
TO CONNECT TO THEIR FACILITIES,
THEIR SENSORS, THEIR DATA, THEIR
NETWORKS. IT'S GOING TO BE
AMAZING FOR SO MANY CUSTOMERS,
BUT SOME CUSTOMERS, OF COURSE,
DON'T WANT THEIR DATA RUNNING
OVER THE PUBLIC INTERNET. AND AS
YOU KNOW, SECURITY IS ALWAYS OUR
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. SO TODAY,
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THAT IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, KUIPER IS
ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE ENTERPRISE
READY PRIVATE CONNECTIVITY
SERVICES. AND NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE DATA FROM
VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE OVER PRIVATE
SECURE CONNECTIONS. AND AS YOU
USE USE THESE CONNECTIONS WITH
YOUR DATA, YOU CAN USE IT INSIDE
OF THE AWS CLOUD TO AN EARLY
ADOPTERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
START TESTING IN THE SECOND HALF
OF 2024. SO WE MAKE BIG BETS
LIKE THESE SO THAT CUSTOMERS CAN
DO THINGS THAT THEY COULDN'T
IMAGINE BEFORE. AND YOU COME ON
THIS JOURNEY WITH US BECAUSE
WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE THESE
KINDS OF AUDACIOUS LEAPS AND THE
BENEFITS HAVE BEEN ENORMOUS. THE
EXCITING CHALLENGE AHEAD OF ALL
OF US THIS NEXT YEAR IS TO LOOK
CLOSELY AT OUR WORK AND TO
REIMAGINE IT, TO REINVENT IT, TO
DREAM UP EXPERIENCES THAT WERE
PREVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE AND MAKE
THEM REAL. WE ARE SO EXCITED TO
BE YOUR PARTNER IN THIS NEW
WORLD THAT WE'RE BUILDING
TOGETHER, AND I'M THRILLED THAT
WE GET TO EXPLORE IT. ALL THIS
WEEK. THIS MORNING. IT'S BEEN
INCREDIBLE. I WANT TO THANK ALL
OF MY GUESTS ON STAGE TODAY AND
THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WATCHING
AND OF COURSE, THANK YOU TO THE
WHOLE AWS TEAM FOR WORKING SO
HARD TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. NOW,
THE TEAM DOES HAVE ONE MORE
LITTLE SURPRISE UP UP THEIR
COLLECTIVE SLEEVE. SO I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE VERY
BEGINNING I MENTIONED LOUD AND
GUITARS IN IRELAND, BUT WE
ACTUALLY HAVE A LOUD GUITAR HERE
FROM OUR FRIENDS AT LOUDEN AND
WE'VE INVITED A TALENTED
GUITARIST A LONG TIME AWS
FAVORITE ZACH PERSON TO PLAY US
OUT. SO WE HAVE GOT A GREAT
CONFERENCE HERE FOR YOU THIS
WEEK. NOW LET'S GET OUT THERE
AND REINVENT. THANK YOU. NOW
TAKE IT AWAY, ZACH.
